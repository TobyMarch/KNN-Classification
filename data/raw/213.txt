<font

the
nature
of
his
music
and
his
own
personal
beliefs,
Pedro
the
Lion's
David
Bazan
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
he
isn't
out
to
convert
anyone.
He's
no
Christian
rocker,
but
he
does
have
a
message,
and
he
wants
you
to
listen.</p>
<p>Bazan
had
agreed
to
do
an
interview
at
the
soundcheck
for
his
July
6
show
at
the
Sokol
Underground
that
also
featured
Velour
100
and
Saddle
Creek
Records
bands
Cursive
and
Bright
Eyes.
I
showed
up
at
the
venue
at
around
7
p.m.
and
sure
enough,
there
he
was,
reclined
in
the
payload
area
of
a
shiny
white
tour
van
that
more
closely
resembled
a
soccer-mom's
SUV
than
a
rock-and-roll
caravan.
Bazan
looked
different
than
the
photos
I'd
seen
online,
which
pictured
a
thin,
Amish-looking
fellow
with
a
beard
and
well-groomed
haircut.
Not
today.
Bazan
was
clean-shaven,
with
a
buzz-cut
that
bordered
on
skin-head.
He
also
looked
chunkier,
sort
of
football
player-buff
in
his
black
T-shirt
and
shorts.
</p>
<p>What's
funny
about
Pedro
the
Lion
is
that
almost
no
one
seemed
to
know
that
their
music
is
predominately
Christian
in
nature.
Including
me.
I
had
even
carefully
reviewed
the
CD
a
few
months
earlier
and
somehow
the
spiritual-ness
of
it
all
just
seemed
to
slip
right
past
me.
I
discovered
my
gaff
after
reading
a
couple
interviews
on
the
'net,
where
Bazan
talked
about
his
faith,
his
music,
and
his
loathing
for
&quot;Christian
Rock.&quot;</p>
</font><p><font>Does
he
mind
talking
about
religion
during
rock
interviews?
&quot;I'm
torn
about
it.
There
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
I
wouldn't
want
to
discuss
it
in
this
venue,&quot;
he
said
across
a
table
that
would
later
be
covered
with
band
merchandise,
set
up
in
the
back
of
the
cavernous
Sokol
Underground.
No
one
had
arrived
except
a
bartender
and
Marc
Leibowitz,
the
show's
promoter
(who
also
wasn't
aware
of
the
band's
religious
nature).
Bandmates
Trey
Many,
bass;
and
Josh
Golden,
drums,
were
off
trying
to
find
a
music
store
to
buy
a
replacement
tube
for
a
blown
guitar.</font></p></td>

<td

of
his
apprehension,
just
about
everything
we
talked
about
in
the
hour
or
so
before
Velour
100
took
the
stage
(Bazan
plays
keyboards
for
that
band,
too)
in
some
way
centered
around
religion
or
faith.
The
son
of
a
music
pastor
for
the
Assemblies
of
God
church,
Bazan
said
that
his
faith
naturally
permeates
his
music
because
it
is
an
extension
of
who
he
is.
&quot;Anyone
with
a
strong,
sincere
belief
in
something
shouldn't
treat
it
lightly,&quot;
he
said
quietly.
&quot;It
seems
I'm
always
being
called
upon
to
boil
down
my
faith
for
interviews.
Defining
it
should
be
done
with
great
care.&quot;</p>
<p>It
is
the
cavalier
attitude
reflected
by
Christian
rockers
--
who
make
a
living
finding
ways
to
make
holy
scripture
fit
alongside
gnarly
power
chords
--
that
drives
Bazan's
hatred
for
their
genre.
In
addition
to
their
music
being
limitlessly
cheesy,
Bazan
believes
Christian
rock
bands
are
wasting
their
time
preaching
from
beneath
a
hot
spotlight
when
&quot;the
basic
act
of
being
creative
glorifies
God.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's
where
Christian
rock
falls
apart,&quot;
he
said.
&quot;It
turns
the
music
and
the
message
into
crap.
The
message
is
degraded
when
it's
made
into
slogans
and
low-level
propaganda.
They're
attempting
to
reach
a
certain
audience
just
like
advertisers
do
--
and
that,
ultimately,
degrades
the
art.&quot;</p>
<p>A
more
pure
model,
he
said,
would
be
to
try
to
express
yourself
artistically,
as
honestly
and
sincerely
as
possible.
But
it's
not
as
simple
as
it
sounds.
Artists
are
constantly
lured
by
the
promise
of
big
money
and
always
seek
approval
from
their
peers.
&quot;It
would
be
na�ve
to
think
you
could
steer
clear
of
the
forces
of
money
and
acceptance,&quot;
Bazan
said,
intensely.
&quot;To
ignore
it
is
to
let
it
rule
you.
You
can
only
control
it
if
you
openly
address
it.&quot;</p>
</font><p><font>Bazan
isn't
immune
to
the
temptations.
&quot;I'm
married.
I'd
like
for
my
records
to
sell
well.
I
get
a
check
and
that
helps
me
and
my
wife
buy
groceries
and
pay
the
rent.
The
economics
of
the
job
are
always
there,
along
with
wanting
to
be
recognized
for
your
work.&quot;</font></p></td>

the
&quot;economics&quot;
are
sparse
while
the
band's
on
the
road
(at
one
time
he
and
drummer
Golden
argued
over
the
price
of
beer
and
fruit
juice
as
if
they
were
debating
over
how
to
use
the
last
of
the
clean
water
on
a
desert
island),
peer
acceptance
is
in
great
supply.
The
band's
recent
CD<i>,
Winners
Never
Quit</i>,
released
earlier
this
year
on
Jade
Tree,
has
been
lauded
by
critics
and
fans
alike
for
its
power,
beauty
and
unconventional
honesty.
</p>
<p>It's
a
concept
album
of
sorts,
a
collection
of
first-person
accounts,
confessions
and
explanations,
all
unregretfully
sung
straight
from
the
attacker's
mouth
(most
of
the
lyrics
are
surrounded
by
quotes).
They
are
macabre
portraits
of
murder
and
violence,
justified
by
necessity
with
only
a
hint
of
regret.
Each
deed
told
is
met
with
a
clear
conscience
of
a
man
who
feels
his
motives
are
misunderstood.
Bazan
makes
the
songs
so
arresting
and,
at
times,
downright
danceable
that
they're
impossible
to
ignore.
His
low,
sullen
voice
recalls
Mark
Kozelek
(Red
House
Painters)
or
Mark
Eitzel
(American
Music
Club)
and
convincingly
adds
the
necessary
pathos
that
compliments
the
stripped-down
arrangements
(Bazan
played
all
the
instruments
on
the
recording).
Half
the
songs
are
slow,
folkish
dirges,
the
other
half
are
indie-guitar-driven
rock
songs.</p>
<p>Call
them
parables,
if
you
will.
The
first
song
on
the
CD,
&quot;Slow
and
Steady
Wins
the
Race,&quot;
directly
addresses
faith
and
its
rewards,
as
the
narrator
sings
about
his
devotion
to
all
that
is
good,
while
his
brother
takes
a
darker
path
through
life.
Thanks
to
his
good
deeds,
he
believes
that
he'll
be
greeted
warmly
in
heaven
with
the
rest
of
the
deserved
few.
</p>
</font><p><font>&quot;The
guy
who
stays
on
the
straight
and
narrow
represents
the
typical
Christian
viewpoint,&quot;
Bazan
said.
&quot;Do
what's
right
at
all
costs.
It
produces
people
who
think
they're
righteous
and
are
going
to
heaven,
and
the
bible's
very
clear
that
no
one
is
good
or
can
earn
their
way
because
our
hearts
are
dark.
The
only
hope
we
have
is
in
the
record
and
performance
of
a
different
person
who's
willing
to
let
us
take
it
all
on
ourselves.&quot;</font></p></td>

he
says
matter-of-factly,
is
Jesus.
If
it
sounds
like
the
interview
was
getting
pretty
heavy,
you're
right.
But
Bazan
doesn't
come
off
as
someone
who's
trying
to
guide
you
on
the
right
path
(remember,
I
asked
the
questions).
He
was
merely
explaining
the
songs
on
his
CD,
most
of
which
happen
to
rock
like
an
old
Jawbreaker
album
despite
the
solemn
lyrics.</p>
<p>There
is
no
&quot;praise
Jesus&quot;
sloganeering
to
be
found.
Instead,
&quot;A
Mind
of
Her
Own&quot;
is
a
husband
arguing
with
his
wife,
beginning
with
&quot;<i>Dear,
unlock
the
door</i>,&quot;
and
ending
with
&quot;<i>You
put
down
that
telephone/You're
not
calling
anyone</i>,&quot;
sung
over
shimmering,
pounding
guitar.
&quot;Never
Leave
a
Job
Half
Done&quot;
opens
just
after
the
narrator
has
killed
his
wife
or
lover,
justifying
his
crime
with
&quot;<i>She
almost
ruined
everything</i>.&quot;
Grim,
but
thoroughly
danceable.
&quot;Eye
on
the
Finish
Line&quot;
is
another
murder
tale
of
a
criminal
with
&quot;a
clear
conscience&quot;
who
fears
his
motives
will
be
misconstrued,
even
by
the
victim:
&quot;<i>Given
the
time
I
think
she
would
have
understood/That
it
was
for
the
greater
good</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>Bazan
shows
us
the
darkest
side
of
human
nature,
and
hopes
we
walk
away
with
a
lesson.
&quot;If
you
think
you're
good
and
you're
proud
of
it,
you
will
be
very,
very
sorry
one
day,&quot;
he
said.
&quot;If
you're
a
total
mess
and
you're
sorry
and
you
don't
know
what
to
do
about
it,
then
there's
hope.</p>
<p>&quot;This
record
is
a
complete,
connected
narrative
from
the
first
to
last
song.
There
was
a
theme
I
wanted
to
communicate:
Damnation
for
the
arrogant,
judgment
for
the
judgmental.&quot;</p>
</font><p><font>Somehow
he's
managed
to
express
this
warning
without
sounding
like
Robert
Duvall
in
The
Apostle,
or
even
someone
whose
life
is
centered
on
his
faith.
He
beliefs
are
far
from
conventional,
however.
Bazan
is
outraged
by
how
politics
have
influenced
religion,
especially
where
moral
issues
are
concerned.

&quot;I
think
it's
totally
tragic
and
wrong,
but
people
need
to
be
convinced
of
that
themselves.
Legislation
convinces
no
one.
The

The

<p>&quot;Everyone
is
so
closed
to
everything,&quot;
he
said
of
a
majority
of
conservative
followers
of
organized
Christianity.
&quot;If
He's
real
and
is
a
real
force
in
my
heart
or
life,
I
don't
have
to
be
closed
to
anything.
I
would
be
the
first
in
line
to
watch
<i>The
Last
Temptation
of
Christ</i>.
It
was
an
utterly
boring
movie,
but
it
wasn't
offensive.
If
He's
God,
why
would
he
care
about
a
movie?
It's
absurd,
but
that's
the
way
a
lot
of
Christians
think.
They
try
to
close
themselves
off
to
experience.
If
they're
that
easily
contaminated,
than
He
isn't
real
to
them
anyway,
He's
removed
and
aloof.
If
He
were
real
to
you,
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.&quot;
</p>
<p>The
discussion
didn't
stop
there.
Bazan
went
on
to
talk
about
popular
culture
vs.
art
(the
brain-vacation
pleasure
of
a
confectionery
movie
like
<i>Mission
Impossible
2</i>
vs.
an
eloquent,
moving
portrait
of
human
nature
like
<i>Magnolia</i>),
big
money
vs.
integrity
(money
can't
buy
happiness
and
being
with
a
major
label
ultimately
would
mean
living
with
the
fact
that
you're
&quot;a
whore
--
it's
a
trade-off,&quot;
he
said),
and
living
a
corporate
life
vs.
taking
a
risk
on
doing
what
you
really
want
to
do
in
life
(&quot;I
quit
my
day-job
to
do
this
and
it
panned
out,
for
others
who've
taken
the
risk,
it
hasn't.
It's
about
courage
and
luck.&quot;)</p>
<p>But
Bazan's
convinced
that
his
rock-and-roll
live
won't
last
forever.
At
the
tender
age
of
24,
he
said
he
believes
in
five
years
he'll
be
making
a
living
doing
something
else.
&quot;I'll
have
a
job
that's
not
Pedro
the
Lion,&quot;
he
said.
&quot;My
wife
(Ann-Krestene),
and
I
agreed
that
I
need
to
do
this
until
I
can't
do
it
anymore.
The
day
will
come
when
the
money
dries
up
and
this
will
take
a
back
seat
to
providing
for
my
family.
It's
inevitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides
financial
pressures,
is
he
getting
tired
of
being
in
a
band
and
writing
music?

<p>&quot;The
human
condition
is
so
complicated,
I
can't
imagine
not
being
inspired,&quot;
he
said.
&quot;Art
could
not
exist
in
a
vacuum.
Artists
are
inspired
by
all
that's
around
them.
Politics
are
dead
with
the
advent
of
big
corporations.
All
the
real
heavy-duty
moral
issues
don't
matter
as
much
as
the
fabric
of
our
lives.
As
things
get
worse
--
as
teen-agers
kill
each
other
in
high
schools,
the
divorce
rate
skyrockets
and
the
number
of
disenfranchised
grows
--
inevitably
there's
more
for
the
artists
to
write
about.</p>
<p>&quot;And
there
are
some
good
things
happening,
as
well,&quot;
he
added,
smiling.</p>
<p>With
that,
Trey
Many
signaled
Bazan
to
the
stage
to
finally
begin
the
soundcheck.</p></font>
