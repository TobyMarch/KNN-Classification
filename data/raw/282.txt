To
Infinity
and
Beyond...<br
/>
<br
/>
Many
exciting
things
are
moving
forward
as
we
head
into
spring
2013.
<br
/>
<br
/>
Tom
is
buried
in
the
studio,
lovingly
coaxing
his
legacy
analogue
equipment
to
bear
with
him
just
a
little
longer
while
he
wraps
up
the
mix
of
his
latest
song,
&quot;Someday.&quot;
Although
he
has
listened
to
it
more
times
than
he
cares
to
count,
he
is
still
very
excited
about
it,
saying,
&quot;This
final
song
might
be
the
title
track
for
the
new
BOSTON
studio
album;
it
reminds
me
of
the
up
tempo
rockers
I
wrote
for
the
debut
album
over
30
years
ago.&quot;
<br
/>
<br
/>
With
a
little
more
tweaking,
then
some
re-tweaking,
then
a
tad
more
tweaking,
Tom
says
the
new
album
should
be
ready
for
release
by
mid
year
...
that
would
be
mid
year
2013.
&quot;After
completing
this
mix
I
only
need
to
redo
vocals
on
a
couple
of
the
cuts,
remix
them,
and
sequence
and
master
the
album.
After
working
on
this
project
for
over
10
years
I
can
finally
see
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel,&quot;
he
says.
Tom
plans
to
start
work
on
the
long
awaited
BOSTON
live
DVD
as
soon
as
the
studio
album
is
finished.<br
/>
<br
/>

/>Meanwhile,
in
other
cool
news,
Gibson
is
honoring
Tom
and
his
original
Les
Paul
with
a
limited
edition
Gibson
Custom
Collectors
Choice
guitar.
(His
is
#10.)
From
Gibson:
&quot;If
you�ve
ever
listened
to
the
music
of
the
legendary
rock
band
BOSTON,
then
you�ve
already
heard
the
latest
Collector�s
Choice
Les
Paul.
In
its
own
right,
this
example
of
a
1968
Goldtop
(now
with
the
top
stripped
off
the
original
finish
to
expose
its
maple
top)
is
an
amazing
instrument;
a
nice,
�cheeky�
neck,
a
flexible
tone
palate
via
Tom�s
preferred
P-90
and
DiMarzio
Super
Distortion
pickup
combination,
and
a
patina
that
comes
from
a
lifetime
of
extensive
live
and
studio
use.
One
of
two
in
Tom
Scholz�s
collection,
this
particular
�68
Les
Paul
Goldtop
Deluxe
is
the
first
'real'
guitar
Tom
ever
owned,
acquired
over
30
years
ago
and
essential
to
his
very
unique
sound
and
career.&quot;
Tom
Loves
the
attention
to
detail
that
was
apparent
in
duplicating
his
guitar.
He
says,
&quot;The
precision
with
which
Gibson
has
replicated
the
physical
properties
of
my
original
Les
Paul
is
astounding.
This
guitar
feels
and
plays
exactly
like
my
guitar,
and
the
resemblance
to
the
original
is
uncanny.
But
most
impressive
is
that
it
actually
sounds
like
my
guitar!
I'm
really
humbled
that
such
an
elite
shop
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
reproduce
the
guitar
I
play.&quot;
Tom
says
he
will
donate
all
the
proceeds
from
his
royalties
on
the
sales
to
charity.<br

In
March,
BOSTON
was
presented
with
the
Legend
Award
at
the
5th
Annual
Limelight
Magazine
Music
Awards
held
at
the
Rock
Junction
in
Coventry,
RI.
The
Legend
Award
honors
bands
that
originated
in
New
England
that
have
been
at
it
for
at
least
25
years.
It's
hard
to
believe
that
it's
been
thirty
seven
years
since
the
debut
album
was
first
heard
on
the
airwaves!<br

Thanks
to
Jason
Kenney
&amp;
Katie
Botelho
at
Limelight
for
their
devotion
to
promoting
New
England
musicians,
recognizing
the
heart,
soul
and
passion
that
it
takes
to
pursue
their
craft,
and
to
all
of
the
fans
who
support
them!
�When
we
solicited
nominations
for
the
Legend
Award
in
early
January,
the
overwhelming
majority
recommended
BOSTON.
We
are
very
pleased
to
present
this
award
to
them
this
year,�
stated
Kenney.
Gary
Pihl
says,
&quot;We've
all
grown
up
listening
to
our
own
legends
like
Chuck
Berry
and
Eric
Clapton,
it's
a
real
honor
that
someone
is
looking
up
to
us
as
a
musical
influence.&quot;
Tom
was
very
humbled
by
the
award,
and
said,
&quot;
I
don't
really
feel
very
legendary,
but
I
sure
do
appreciate
all
those
people
who
recognize
the
effort
that
has
gone
into
BOSTON's
music
over
the
years
...
thank
you.&quot;<br
/>
<br
/>
In
addition
to
having
friendly
staff,
great
food
and
local
and
national
acts
performing
live,
the
Rock
Junction
which
hosted
the
awards
surprised
Tom
and
Gary
with
a
unique
piece
of
BOSTON
history
...
as
they
took
the
stage
to
accept
the
award
they
stood
in
front
of
the
drum
riser
that
was
used
on
5
BOSTON
tours!
The
riser
was
so
large,
a
new
stage
was
constructed
to
accommodate
it.
Rumor
has
it
that
drummers
performing
at
the
club
love
it
...
it's
big!
The
acoustics
are
surprisingly
good
at
this
venue,
you
can
actually
hear
the
people
on
stage
as
well
as
the
ones
next
to
you.<br
/>
<br
/>
Last
month
bandmates
Gary
Pihl,
Tommy
DeCarlo
and
David
Victor
performed
at
the
Kidz
b
Kidz
5th
anniversary
party
in
Boston.
Supporting
Kidz
b
Kidz
benefits
those
dedicated
to
enhancing
the
lives
of
children
who
are
in
the
hospital,
and
those
determined
to
find
cures
for
them.
Proceeds

with
their

projects.
They
all
had
a

BOSTON
SUMMER
SHOWS<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;What
the
critics
are
saying&quot;<br
/><br
/>
Boston
still
has
what
it
takes
to
rock
And
best
of
all,
it
didn't
sound
overly
familiar.
It
didn't
sound
tired.
It
didn't
sound
done.
Rather,
songs
as
recognizable
as
&quot;Peace
of
Mind&quot;
and
&quot;More
Than
a
Feeling&quot;
seemed
fresh,
energized
and
even
surprising
...
ON
MILWAUKEE<br
/><br
/>
The
main
event,
BOSTON,
lived
up
to
their
top
of
the
bill
standing.
They
once
again
proved
why
they
are
the
most
underrated
live
act
that
I
have
seen.
Studio
recordings
of
Boston
music
are
great
enough
in
their
own
right,
but
seeing
them
in
a
live
setting,
really
makes
one
appreciate
what
they
are
witnessing.
The
sheer
musicianship
that
comes
together
during
their
many
extended
instrumental
pieces
should
make
any
real
music
fan
bow
in
Wayne's
World
fashion
saying
&quot;We're
not
worthy!
We're
not
worthy!&quot;

Boston
at
its
best.
All
the
favorites,
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
recordings.
Mr
Scholz
is
a
master
musician/composer/arranger/technician.
He
has
managed
to
collect
a
group
of
musicians
(some
from
the
old
days,
some
from
the
not
so
old
days)
who
recreated
his
musical
vision
incredibly
well.
It
is
one
thing
to
make
music
like
that
in
the
studio,
with
all
the
benefits
of
digital
recording.
It
is
another
to
see
and
hear
it
reproduced
live.
As
a
musician
myself,
I
was
astounded
to
see
the
performance
of
so
many
pieces
so
well
executed.
As
a
fan,
I
had
a
ball
listening
to
those
old
classic
songs

Boston
was
awesome!!!
This

knows
how
to
put
on
a
show.
The
addition
of
David
Victor
to
the
band
did
them
justice.
Tommy

pays
tribute
to
the
late
Brad

REVIEWER<br

Baseball
caps
off
to
Tommy
DeCarlo,
the
current
lead
singer
for
the
band
for
filling
the
big
cleats
of
Bradley
Delp
who
unfortunately
took
his
own
life
in
2007.
Having
never
seen
the
band
live
I
was
skeptical
at
what
the
vocals
would
sound
like.
Delp
had
a
unique
voice
and
style
that
contributed
to
the
bands
iconic
sound.
DeCarlo
hit
it
out
of
the
park
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
and
hit
every
note
and
captured
the
spirit
of
Delp
on
each
song.

<hr

<br
/><img

/><br
/>
There
are
very
few
bands
out
there
whose
music
actually
defines
a
genre.<br
/><br
/>
But
it's
safe
to
say
when
you
think
of
Boston,
the
term
'classic
rock'
is
first
and
foremost.<br
/><br
/>
And
it's
classic
not
in
the
sense
of
it
being
old,
outdated
or
unfashionable,
but
classic
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
pop
culture,
the
music
industry
itself
and
on
the
timeless
quality
of
the
songs
themselves.<br
/><br
/>
Very
few
bands
made
the
impact
that
Boston
(the
band
prefers
its
name
all
in
capital
letters
to
differentiate
it
from
the
city
from
which
it
hails)
did
when
it
released
it's
debut,
self-titled
album
in
1976.<br
/><br
/>
Rather
than
having
just
one
hit
single,
that
album
spawned
a
series
of
hits
that
continue
to
be
staples
of
rock
radio
airplay.<br
/><br
/>
From
the
epic
More
Than
A
Feeling,
to
Smokin',
Long
Time,
Rock
and
Roll
Band,
and
Hitch
A
Ride,
Boston
redefined
rock
music
from
a
technical
and
musical
standpoint.<br
/><br
/>
To
date
it
has
sold
17
million
copies
in
the
U.S.
alone.<br
/><br
/>
There
probably
would
have
been
no
Foreigner,
Journey,
or
other
big
arena
rock
bands
of
that
ilk
if
not
for
the
ground
that
was
broken
by
Boston
mastermind
Tom
Scholz,
the
band's
guitarist,
primary
songwriter
and
producer.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;When
that
album
came
out,
it
was
so
unique.
The
sound
of
the
guitars
and
the
sound
of
the
recording
was
so
special.
I
remember
driving
my
car,
in
my
hometown
of
Petaluna,
California,
and
I
pulled
up
to
a
stoplight
and
was
waiting
for
it
to
change,
and
More
Than
A
Feeling
came
on
the
radio.
And
I
was
so
into
it.
And
the
guy
in
the
car
in
front
of
me,
he
happened
to
be
someone
that
I
knew.
He
jumped
out
of
his
car,
ran
back
to
my
car
and
said,
'are
you
listening
to
that
station
and
hearing
this
band.
It's
awesome!'&quot;
said
guitarist
Gary
Pihl
who,
after
Scholz,
is
the
longest-tenured
member
of
Boston,
having
been
in
the
band
since
1985,
after
leaving
Sammy
Hagar's
touring
band
when
the
Red
Rocker
joined
Van
Halen.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;Everybody
just
flipped
out
because
it
was
so
unique.
How
did
they
get
that
sound?
And
then
there
was
the
content
itself.
Everyone
could
sing
along.
Everyone
could
relate
to
the
stories
in
the
lyrics.
Then
the
band
toured
and
they
were
terrific
live.
I
think
all
of
those
things
combine
to
keep
the
music
and
the
band
so
interesting.
Even
today,
people
come
to
the
shows
and
ask,
'how
do
you
get
that
sound?'&quot;<br
/><br
/>
The
sound
he
speaks
of
is
a
combination
of
what
would
be
called
layered
guitars,
a
sound
that
has
become
one
of
Boston
and
Tom
Scholz'
signatures.<br
/><br
/>
Queen's
Brian
May
has
a
similar
sound,
but
much
of
the
early
Queen
material
was
recorded
through
multiple
amplifiers
with
multiple
guitar
tracks.<br
/><br
/>
Scholz,
an
electronics
whiz,
developed
a
device
that
he
later
called
the
Rockman,
which
creates
the
same
sound
as
multiple
amps
and
tracks
...
but
is
smaller
than
a
shoebox.<br
/><br
/>
Eventually,
Scholz
built
a
little
mini
music
tech
empire
[which
he
sold
a
few
years
ago]
around
The
Rockman
and
his
other
inventions,
many
of
which
made
it
possible
for
bands
and
musicians
to
record
at
home,
rather
than
spending
huge
amounts
of
money
on
studio
sessions.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;In
my
mind,
he
started
the
record-at-home
revolution
because
he
recorded
that
first
Boston
album
at
home
in
his
basement.
And
once
that
news
came
out,
every
other
musician
said,
'you
mean
I
don't
have
to
spend
$125
an
hour
to
record
an
album?'
So
he
was
the
first
to
record
a
hit
album
at
home.
All
the
recording
equipment
manufacturers
picked
up
on
that
and
said,
'wow,
we
can
sell
to
all
musicians
as
opposed
to
just
selling
our
products
to
recording
studios,&quot;
said
Pihl
who
was
hired
by
Scholz
to
demonstrate
his
gadgets
at
industry
trade
shows,
and
eventually
became
an
employee
of
not
only
Scholz,
but
a
member
of
his
band.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;We
have
had
many
musicians
tell
us
how
much
they
used
the
equipment.
We
used
to
tell
people
it
was
like
an
A
to
Z
of
the
industry;
from
Alabama
to
ZZ
Top
used
to
call
us
to
say
they
were
using
The
Rockman
on
their
new
record.
Def
Leppard
sent
us
a
gold
record
because
of
how
much
they
liked
the
technology.
Joe
Satriani,
Joe
Walsh,
Jeff
Beck,
the
list
just
goes
on
and
on
for
people
who
have
used
that
little
device
that
Tom
invented
to
help
him
record
at
home.&quot;<br
/><br
/>
Boston's
first
album
was
six
years
in
the
making,
but
as
with
any
hit
band,
the
pressure
from
the
music
industry
to
produce
a
follow-up
was
big.<br
/><br
/>
Don't
Look
Back
came
out
two
years
later,
in
1978,
which
doesn't
seem
like
a
long
space
of
time,
but
in
the
1970s,
when
bands
like
Kiss
put
out
two
albums
a
year,
it
was
an
eternity.<br
/><br
/>
Legal
hassles
prevented
the
third
album
from
coming
out
until
1986,
but
fans
were
patient,
and
Third
Stage,
which
was
Pihl's
first
recorded
work
with
Boston
became
a
radio
hit
on
the
strength
of
hits
like
We're
Ready,
Amanda
and
Cool
The
Engines.<br
/><br
/>
A
fourth
album,
Walk
On
didn't
come
out
until
1994,
while
Corporate
America,
the
band's
last
album,
came
out
in
2002.<br
/><br
/>
The
band's
touring
schedule
has
also
been
infrequent,
with
Boston
last
hitting
the
road
in
2008,
which
is
also
the
last
time
the
band
came
to
Canada.<br
/><br
/>
On
the
summer
2012
tour,
the
band
will
be
coming
to
Belleville
as
part
of
the
Empire
Rockfest
Series,
playing
Friday,
July
27,
the
night
after
playing
at
Casino
Rama
near
Barrie.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;In
general,
we
like
to
tour
when
we
have
a
new
album
or
greatest
hits
package
or
something.
And
new
albums
are
kind
of
few
and
far
between.
We
hope
that
with
our
tours
it's
a
question
of
quality
rather
than
quantity.
We're
always
working
on
new
songs,
but
we're
not
quick
in
the
studio,&quot;
said
Pihl,
confirming
media
reports
that
there
is
indeed
a
new
Boston
album
in
the
work.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;Tom
has
been
on
record
as
saying
that
it's
about
85
per
cent
complete.
We
were
hoping
to
have
it
out
this
year,
but
it
wasn't
quite
ready.
But
because
we
thought
it
might
be
out,
Tom
said
we
should
do
some
touring.
It's
been
a
while.
It's
been
four
years.
And
he
said
it
didn't
matter
that
the
record
wasn't
out,
he
said,
'let's
go
out
anyways.'
And
I
said,
'great!'&quot;<br
/><br
/>
Pihl
said
there
won't
be
any
new
material
in
the
set,
but
that
some
older
Boston
musical
chestnuts
might
make
an
appearance
after
many
years.<br
/><br
/>
There
is
also
scuttlebutt
within
the
music
industry
that
some
vocal
tracks
from
Brad
Delp,
the
band's
longtime
vocalist,
may
make
an
appearance
on
the
new
album.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;Tommy
DeCarlo
was
with
us
on
the
last
tour.
And
as
some
people
may
know,
we
found
him
on
MySpace.
Somebody
called
us
and
told
us
about
this
guy
doing
Boston
songs
on
MySpace
...
so
we
checked
it
out,
we
loved
it
and
called
him
up,&quot;
Pihl
explained.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;And
he
had
never
been
in
a
band
in
his
life,
he
just
recorded
the
songs
on
his
own
at
home
and
posted
them.
But
he
has
a
great
voice
and
was
a
heck
of
a
nice
guy
and
we
asked
him
to
come
on
tour.
So
he's
back,
and
better
than
ever.&quot;<br
/><br
/>
The
rest
of
the
Boston
touring
lineup
includes
vocalist
David
Victor,
bassist
Tracy
Ferrie,
and
drummer
Curly
Smith,
making
a
return
to
the
drummer's
stool
after
a
number
of
years.<br
/><br
/>
Delp
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
signature
Boston
sound
as
was
Scholz's
powerhouse
guitar
licks
and
production
skills,
and
his
passing
was
a
tragedy
not
only
for
his
family
and
friends,
but
also
for
lovers
of
melodic
rock
and
roll,
as
sung
by
a
truly
unique
talent.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;There
was
nobody
like
Brad.
He
was
a
wonderful
guy.
It
was
Sammy
Hagar
that
first
said
publicly
that
Brad
was
the
nicest
guy
in
rock
and
roll.
So
we
certainly
miss
him,&quot;
said
Pihl.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;Brad
really
hit
those
high
notes,
and
outside
of
Freddie
Mercury,
that
just
wasn't
done,
because
it
wasn't
the
style.&quot;<br
/><br
/>
Besides
working
in
Boston,
Pihl
is
also
part
of
a
band
called
December
People,
which
tours
the
U.S.
during
the
holiday
season.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;We
had
the
idea
of
doing
traditional
holiday
songs,
but
in
the
styles
of
other
rock
bands.
And
all
the
shows
would
be
benefits
for
the
local
food
banks.
So
wherever
we
go,
the
food
bank
gets
a
big
donation.
And
when
I
was
told
that
I
said,
'hey,
count
me
in,'&quot;
he
said.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;So
we
start
off
playing
and
it
sounds
like
Pinball
Wizard
by
The
Who,
but
we
start
singing
Joy
to
the
World.
And
we
do
Santa
Claus
is
coming
to
town
like
ZZ
Top
doing
La
Grange.
And
the
audience
just
loves
it.,
and
have
such
a
great
time
doing
it.
It's
a
great
bunch
of
guys
in
the
band,
and
it's
for
worthy
causes.&quot;<br
/><br
/>
Returning
to
the
subject
of
Boston's
leader
and
musical
maestro,
Pihl
said
Scholz
may
just
be
one
of
the
most
underrated
figures
in
rock
history.<br
/><br
/>
&quot;When
they
talk
about
the
100
best
guitarists
of
rock,
Tom
is
always
there.
But
he
is
there
amongst
the
top
keyboard
players
of
all
time.
And
how
about
the
top
100
songs
of
all
time?
There's
always
a
couple
of
Boston
songs
there.
And
he's
considered
to
be
one
of
the
top
producers
and
engineers
of
all
time.
So
he
is
a
very
unique
guy,&quot;
Pihl
said
of
his
friend
of
35-plus
years.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;But
he
is
so
down
to
earth,
and
a
wonderful
guy
to
work
with
...
and
very
humble.
He
just
really
cares
about
people.
And
he
doesn't
really
like
the
limelight.
He
isn't
the
guy
with
the
big
ego
that
goes
around
saying,
'hey,
I
am
a
rock
star,
look
at
me.'
He'd
rather
just
walk
down
the
street
and
be
a
regular
guy.&quot;<br
/><br
/>
Regular
guy
or
not,
Scholz
and
his
bandmates
can
still
rock
a
crowd
with
some
of
the
best
rock
riffs
ever
written.
And
fans
in
the
Belleville
area
and
Simcoe
County
will
get
a
chance
to
find
that
out
first
hand.<br

<br
/>
In
1976
my
freshman
dorm
at
Lafayette
College
listened
to
Boston's
first
album
so
much,
we
practically
adopted
the
band.
We
just
gorged
on
that
supersonic
smorgasbord
of
hammering
guitars,
slamming
vocals
and
party-hearty
harmonies.<br
/>
<br
/>
I
had
several
happy
flashbacks
to
those
heady
days
in
McKeen
Hall
during
Boston's
concert
Monday
night
at
RiverPlace.
A
near
sellout
crowd
of
6,017
heard
rock
'n'
roll
that
pounded
the
soul
and
rearranged
vital
organs.<br
/>
<br
/>
Guitarist
Tom
Scholz,
the
only
survivor
of
the
original
quintet,
created
chiming,
spooning,
buzzsawing
duets
with
guitarist
Gary
Pihl,
second
in
seniority
with
23
years.
Bassist
Kimberley
Dahme
and
drummer
Jeff
Neal,
both
relative
babes
in
the
woods,
offered
a
potent
one-two
punch.
Founding
lead
vocalist
Brad
Delp,
who
committed
suicide
last
year,
was
replaced
seamlessly
by
newcomers
Michael
Sweet,
founding
frontman
of
Stryper,
the
Christian
metalsmiths,
and
Tommy
DeCarlo,
a
Home
Depot
credit
manager
hired
because
of
his
deft
Delp-like
performances
of
Boston
tunes
on
MySpace.<br
/>
<br
/>
DeCarlo's
tart,
ringing
singing
helped
make
&quot;Feelin'
Satisfied&quot;
very
satisfying.
Sweet's
pointy,
lusty
voice
powered
&quot;Peace
of
Mind,&quot;
which
he
recently
covered
with
Stryper.
He
doubled
as
the
evening's
best
entertainer,
bending
over
his
guitar,
tossing
his
long
hair
and
twirling
in
a
punk
trance
like
some
Ramone.<br
/>
<br
/>
The
highlight
of
the
night
was
an
orgasmic
&quot;Foreplay/Long
Time.&quot;
The
former
featured
an
almost
anarchic
web
of
sonorities.
The
latter
featured
Sweet's
foaming
voice,
Pihl's
raving
solo
and
a
levitating
finale.<br
/>

Tom
Scholz
Still
Rockin'
with
Two
Les
Paul
Goldtops<br
/>
</b><br
/>
Tom
Scholz's
reputation
as
a
technological
wizard
and
gear-hound
is
well
deserved,
as
the
Boston
guitarist
holds
enough
electronics-related
patents
to
wallpaper
his
home
studio.
That
being
the
case,
you
might
surmise
the
veteran
player
owns
a
commensurate
number
of
electric
guitars.
In
fact,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;I
have
only
two
guitars,&quot;
Scholz
says.
&quot;They're
both
old
Les
Paul
Goldtops.
I
bought
them
both
used,
at
a
time
when
I
didn't
know
anything
about
Les
Pauls.
Somebody
told
me
that
these
two
guitars
were
made
for
only
six
months,
during
half
of
1968,
so
there
are
only
a
very
few
in
existence.
The
neck
on
the
guitar
is
completely
different
from
the
neck
on
every
other
type
of
Les
Paul.
It's
huge.
At
first
I
couldn't
play
on
it
at
all,
and
then
after
finally
learning
how
to
play
on
it,
I
discovered
that
there
weren't
any
others
available.
But
the
amazing
thing
is
I
found
two
of
them,
without
knowing
that
the
second
one
was
from
1968
as
well,
from
that
six
month
period.
This
happened
before
the
first
Boston
album
was
released.
I
needed
a
second
guitar
before
we
went
on
the
road,
so
I
snatched
it
up.
I
bought
both
guitars
for
about
$300.&quot;<br

/>To
celebrate
the
life
of
Boston
lead
singer
Brad
Delp,
whose
suicide
this
past
March
roiled
the
rock
world,
Scholz
staged
a
five-hour
musical
event
last
month
at
Boston's
Bank
of
America
Pavilion.
Titled
&quot;Come
Together:
A
Tribute
to
Brad
Delp,&quot;
the
event
saw
past
and
present
Boston
personnel
who,
historically,
have
been
a
contentious
bunch,
putting
aside
their
differences
to
pay
homage
to
the
much
loved
singer.
Inevitably,
any
public
appearance
by
Scholz
fuels
speculation
about
future
Boston
studio
albums.
Given
the
guitarist's
legendary
perfectionism,
it's
doubtful
a
new
release
will
be
forthcoming
any
time
soon.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;Most
of
what
I
record,
nobody
ever
hears,&quot;
Scholz
says.
&quot;At
least
90
percent
of
it
goes
into
a
box,
which
now
weighs
a
couple
hundred
pounds.
Basically
when
I
start
working
on
something,
all
I
have
are
ideas.
They
just
come
in
a
flood,
and
I
try
as
many
of
them
as
I
can.
Sometimes
they're
very
simple
things,
like
whether
to
double-track
or
triple-track
a
part.
And
sometimes
it's
more
complicated
things,
like
changing
lyrics
or
the
melody,
or
deciding
whether
or
not
to
use
vocal
harmonies.
Each
song
takes
an
awful
lot
of
time.&quot;

<span

gathering
at
the

prior
to
Brad's
tribute
on

19
provided
a
great

of
the
musicians.
The

writer
Andy
Greene
has
asked
me
for
some
recollections
about
my
experiences
with
Brad.
An
edited
version
of
the
reply
I
sent
him
appeared
on
rollingstone.com
with
questions
inserted
in
the
text.
Here
is
the
complete
unedited
note
I
sent
to
Andy:<br
/>
<br
/>
Andy,<br
/>
<br
/>
Thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
answer
your
questions
by
e-mail.
I
haven't
been
in
the
mood
to
talk
to
people
much
for
the
last
few
days
as
you
might
imagine,
but
I
appreciate
you
turning
to
me
for
this.
Brad
and
I
were
friends
and
collaborators
for
35
years.
Both
of
us
being
vegetarians,
non-drug
users
and
more
interested
in
music
than
money,
put
us
in
a
very
small
minority
in
the
music
business;
our
bond
ran
much
deeper
than
just
BOSTON
music.<br
/>
<br
/>
In
answer
to
your
questions:<br
/>
<br
/>
I
met
Brad,
soft
spoken
and
unassuming,
when
he
auditioned
in
a
recording
studio
outside
of
Boston
one
night
to
sing
several
songs
I
had
written.
Back
then
in
the
early
seventies
recording
a
song
demo
meant
coming
up
with
a
significant
amount
of
money,
several
weeks
of
my
day
job
savings,
to
buy
a
few
hours
of
8
track
time.<br
/>
<br
/>
Having
endured
countless
sessions
with
other
singers,
most
with
undeserved
egos,
I
had
only
the
faintest
glimmer
of
hope
that
he
might
be
good
enough
to
squeak
by
as
a
suitable
vocalist.<br
/>
<br
/>
He
didn't
warm
up;
he
just
listened
to
the
prerecorded
instrument
track
once.
Then
he
started
to
sing.
I
don't
know
if
it
took
two
seconds
or
three,
but
before
he
finished
singing
the
first
line
I
knew
that
some
guardian
angel
had
just
delivered
to
me
one
of
the
best
vocalists
ever
to
step
up
to
a
microphone!
Then
he
kept
going
and
I
realized
he
wasn't
just
one
of
the
best,
he
was
amazing!
High
notes
I
hadn't
heard
before
followed
by
harmonies,
and
overdubbed
exact
duplicate
layered
tracks,
all
with
ease,
all
with
emotion,
and
yet
all
technically
precise.<br
/>
<br
/>
Before
we
left
that
night
he
had
rewritten
the
lyrics
and
the
melody,
sung
all
the
vocal
parts,
and
with
the
magic
of
his
voice
turned
my
stark
guitar
riff
into
a
song!
From
that
moment
on
I
only
hoped
I
could
write
and
record
music
worthy
of
his
attention
and
interpretation.<br
/>
<br
/>
There
were
soulful
notes
that
pulled
you
into
the
song,
stratospheric
screams
and
angelic
high
notes,
and
after
hitting
these
record
breaking
notes
he'd
go
back
and
sing
a
harmony
part
above
it!
He
didn't
rehearse
any
of
these
parts,
he
could
jump
back
and
forth
between
harmony
parts,
double
tracking
parts,
and
then
go
back
and
do
it
again
exactly
the
same
with
one
tiny
change,
adjusting
all
the
other
singing
parts
to
fit
with
bionic
accuracy.<br
/>
<br
/>
You'd
think
anyone
with
this
super
human
talent
would
be
an
insufferable
egomaniac.
But
Brad
was
just
the
opposite,
and
amazingly
he
remained
honestly
humble
in
spite
of
the
incredible
star
pressure
that
followed
BOSTON's
success.<br
/>
<br
/>
Brad
and
I
banged
our
heads
against
the
wall
trying
to
get
a
break
with
record
companies
for
five
years.
During
that
time
he
and
I
did
a
lot
of
basement
recording;
we
received
absolutely
zero
recognition
locally
and
complete
rejection
submitting
our
demos
to
national
record
labels.
I
think
this
experience
put
our
future
success
in
perspective
as
we
both
realized
that
after
so
many
years
of
insult,
we
were
just
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
record
and
play
music
above
ground!
Unlike
many
other
individuals
eventually
involved
with
BOSTON,
Brad's
down
to
earth
personality
never
wavered;
it
was
his
natural
demeanor.<br
/>
<br
/>
When
someone
asked
me
what
Brad
was
like,
the
first
words
that
always
came
to
mind
were
&quot;nice
guy.&quot;
Oddly,
his
incredible
performing
abilities
seem
barely
worth
mentioning
compared
to
his
attributes
as
a
human
being.
He
was
soft
spoken
yet
very
quick
and
funny.
Although
I
rarely
remember
seeing
him
in
the
throws
of
a
good
belly
laugh,
he
could
keep
the
people
around
him
in
stitches
effortlessly,
and
did
so
on
a
daily
basis.
When
he
wasn't
making
someone
laugh,
or
giving
his
time
to
a
fan,
he
was
a
tireless
worker,
both
in
the
studio
and
on
stage.<br
/>
<br
/>
He
and
I
had
a
very
strong
personal
connection
because
of
our
moral
beliefs,
yet
we
were
drastically
different
kinds
of
people.
While
I
am
rebellious
and
easily
provoked
to
an
unyielding
defense,
Brad
was
passive
and
studiously
non
confrontational.<br
/>
<br
/>
Somehow
over
the
years
I
think
we
both
grew
not
only
to
accept
this
in
each
other,
but
to
respect
it;
I
think
this
is
part
of
the
reason
we
were
able
to
work
together
for
so
much
of
our
lives.
In
an
odd
parallel
we
were
also
opposites
in
the
studio.
Once
Brad
would
laid
down
a
vocal
track
he
became
instantly
committed
to
it
and
would
dig
in
if
challenged,
whereas
I
would
want
to
change
everything
and
never
be
sure.
We
were
usually
at
odds
on
how
vocal
arrangements
should
go
also,
which
in
early
years
caused
heated
debates.
Later
we
both
developed
such
respect
for
each
other's
abilities
that
the
collaboration,
so
important
to
the
eventual
outcome
of
BOSTON's
music,
became
much
easier.
It
was
largely
my
music,
but
it
was
Brad
who
brought
it
to
life,
and
this
struggle
we
both
had
to
endure
was
part
of
what
made
it
so
many
people's
favorite.<br
/>
<br
/>
I
last
saw
Brad
at
rehearsal
last
month
where
we
prepared
several
old
and
new
songs
for
our
upcoming
summer
shows.
These
are
my
fondest
memories,
playing
music
with
my
friend
and
the
greatest
singer
in
rock
and
roll.<br
/>
<br
/>
Andy,
Brad
and
I
have
been
used
and
abused
throughout
our
adult
life
by
the
music
business,
it
continues
even
in
his
death.
Please
do
the
right
thing
with
this.
Sorry
I
wrote
you
a
tome.<br

&quot;The
Definitive
200
urges
people
to
remember
that
most
of
their
favorite
songs
are
part
of
a
unique
art
form,
the
album,&quot;
said
NARM
President
Jim
Donio.
&quot;In
an
era
when
record
stores
and
album
sales
are
somewhat
embattled,
NARM
thought
it
was
the
perfect
time
to
release
this
list,
and
have
retailers
promote
these
great,
classic
albums.
There
are
no
&quot;Greatest
Hits&quot;
or
&quot;Best
Of&quot;
compilations.
We
are
reminding
folks
what
we
already
know
to
be
true:
albums,
just
like
record
stores,
aren't
going
anywhere!&quot;
<br
/>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">The
list
was
chosen
by
a
committee
of
NARM
retailers.
Their
selections
spanned
the
past
50
years
of
modern
popular
music.
A
handful
of
artists
have
multiple
albums
on
the
list.
&quot;In
compiling
the
list,&quot;
continues
Donio,
&quot;we
asked
retailers
to
think
about
the
titles
that
fans
keep
coming
back
to,
the
titles
that
stand
out
for
them.
It's
not
just
about
sales,
although
albums
that
have
sold
well
are
obviously
represented
here.
It's
really
about
the
passion
that
music
buyers
have
shown
for
these
particular
titles
and
the
albums'
potential
for
enduring
popularity
today
with
new
audiences.
From
Pop,
Country,
R
and
B,
and
Hip
Hop
albums
just
a
few
years
old,
to
Rock,
Blues,
and
Jazz
classics
released
decades
ago,
the
Definitive
200
are
the
albums
everyone
should
own.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><span

&quot;The
Rock
and

Hall
of

was
really
pleased
to
be
asked
to
be
part
of
this
celebration,&quot;
said
Rock
Hall
President
and
CEO
Joel
Peresman.
&quot;The
Definitive
200
honors
a
very
diverse
group
of

and
encourages
fans
to
look

In

Doug
Flutie
Day
in
Boston














</headline>
<br
/>
<br
/>
<span
class="text">The
city
of
Boston
celebrated
Nov.
13,
2006
as
Doug
Flutie
Day.
Flutie
is
seen
here
accepting
the
2006
Red,
White,
and
Blue
Award
for
his
work
in
promoting
awareness
and
support
for
families
with
autism.
The
award
is
given
each
year
to
one
of
Boston's
&quot;local
heroes.&quot;
<br
/>
<br
/>
The
award
was
given
to
Bruce
Springsteen
in
2004
and
Oscar
Robertson
in
2005.
In
addition
to
receiving
the
award,
a
concert
was
held
at
Symphony
Hall
featuring
Keith
Lockhart
(conductor
for
the
Boston
Pops)
and
the
rock
group
Boston.
All
benefits
will
go
towards
The
Doug
Flutie,
Jr.
Foundation
for
Autism.
Also
on
the
show
was
the
James
Montgomery
Blues
Band
and
Special
Guests.<br
/>
<br
/>
In
1998,
Flutie
and
his
wife,
Laurie,
began
raising
funds
for
autism.
In
2000
they
established
the
Doug
Flutie,
Jr.
Foundation
for
Autism
to
honor
of
their
son
Doug,
Jr.,
who
has
autism.
<br
/>
<br
/>
The
foundation,
which
to
date
has
raised
over
$8
million,
strives
to
provide
aid
for
disadvantaged
families
affected
by
autism,
fund
education
and
research
about
autism,
and
serves
as
a
forum
for
new
programs
and
services
relating
to
the
disease.<br
/>

/>
<img

alt=""
height="178"
width="400"

hspace="5"
/>The
band
Boston
performed
some
of
their
favorite
songs
including
&quot;To
Be
A
Man&quot;
as
a
tribute
to
Doug.
About
a
dozen
musicians
from
the
Pops
provided
orchestral
backing
with
strings,
horns
and
percussion
to
make
it
a
truly
special
performance.<br
/>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span

<question>















Before
I
had
a
chance
to
listen
to
them,
I
read
a
wonderful,
telling
statement
in
regard
to
the
reissues
of
Boston
and
Don't
Look
Back:
&quot;remastered
under
Tom
Scholz's
supervision.&quot;














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
It's
true.
I
did
them
up
here
in
New
England
with
a
couple
of
trusted
engineer
friends
of
mine,
and
we
more
than
supervised,
we
took
those
things
apart
piece
by
piece.
Every
nut
and
bolt
came
out
of
those
songs.
We
tweaked
all
of
the
things
that
couldn't
be
done
with
the
mixes
in
the
'70s.
I
hadn't
been
able
to
listen
to
either
one
of
those
albums
since
they
were
first
released
on
CD
in
the
'80s,
or
whenever.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















There
were
also
Super
Bit
Mapped
CDs
of
both
albums
that
came
out
in
the
'90s.














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">You
know
what?
It
doesn't
really
matter.
I
mean,
16-bit
audio
absolutely
destroys
the
waveform,
especially
in
the
high
end.
A
lot
of
things
that
I
thought
were
fine
on
vinyl
or
cassette
tape
parts
that
had
a
lot
of
brightness
and
sibilance
in
them
sounded
horrible
on
16-bit
CD.
I
literally
could
not
listen
to
those
albums
on
CD
all
these
years.
I
saw
this
as
a
huge
opportunity.
I
dropped
everything,
I
shut
down
a
10-day
vacation
I
had
just
started
around
my
birthday
[March
10]
and
went
to
work.
We
just
literally
went
through
those
things
second
by
second
or,
I
should
say,
millisecond
by
millisecond
and
did
all
the
things
you
can
do
now
with
automated
EQ
and
other
signal-processing
techniques.
Since
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
digital
format
anyway,
there
was
nothing
to
lose.

<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















Did
you
have
the
original
masters
yourself?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
I
didn't.
They
[Sony]
had
the
original,
quarter-inch-tape
stereo
masters,
and
did
a
very
good
job
of
doing
the
A/D
conversion.
I
have
to
tell
you,
I
would
have
been
sweating
bullets
doing
that
myself.
So
we
had
good
24-bit
transfers
to
start
with.
I'm
really
excited
about
how
they
came
out,
and
I
never
thought
I'd
get
excited
about
something
I
did
30
years
ago.
I
can
finally
listen
to
these
mixes
on
CD
now.
[laughs]</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















What
kinds
of
problems
were
apparent
to
you
on
the
original
CDs?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">First
of
all,
expectations
for
the
tone
balance
on
recorded
music
has
changed
considerably
over
the
last
30
years.
For
example,
the
amount
of
low
end
in
a
bass
instrument
is
a
helluva
lot
higher
in
mixes
today.
And
there
were
a
lot
of
problems
in
the
treble
ranges,
which
I
attribute
largely
to
the
trouble
with
16-bit
audio
in
general
and
maybe
somewhat
to
the
fact
that
vinyl
and
tape
did
a
good
job
of
toning
those
things
down
for
reproduction
back
in
the
old
days.
What
I
did
was
correct
everything
that
I
didn't
like:
things
that
couldn't
be
done
in
the
original
mix,
which
was
all
done
by
hand,
and
things
that
couldn't
be
done
in
the
original
mastering,
which,
of
course,
was
done
by
hand
as
well,
and,
back
in
those
days,
was
quite
limited.
Even
in
a
nice
mastering
room
like
Capitol
Records,
you
had
very
little
opportunity
to
make
adjustments
or
changes.
Of
course,
going
into
a
24-bit,
modern-day
editing
program,
you
can
basically
do
whatever
your
knowledge,
imagination,
and
time
will
allow.
And
we
did
have
a
very
severe
time
crunch
since
we
had
gotten
Sony
to
stop
going
forth
with
their
own
remaster.
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















That
would
have
been
a
disaster.














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
Yeah.
It
did
sound
terrible.
So
we
got
into
it,
and
did
nothing
in
between
working
on
these
mixes
except
sleep.
Remastering
the
whole
thing
took
8
days
of
12-14
hours
a
day,
straight
through.
I
was
really
happy
with
what
we
got.
You
hear
a
lot
of
things
you
didn't
hear
before,
and
things
that
used
to
irritate
me
or
sound
screechy
now
sound
full
and
natural.
For
example,
[singer]
Brad
[Delp's]
voice
was
warmed
up
the
way
it
should
be.
And
you
can
really
feel
that
bass
guitar
instead
of
just
hearing
it.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















Any
other
specific
examples?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">We
made
thousands
of
changes,
thousands:
every
vocal
line,
every
guitar
part,
the
whole
bottom
end.
The
bass
has
been
brought
up
in
the
mix
relative
to
the
bass
in
the
kick
drum,
which
gives
a
heckuva
lot
more
punch
from
the
bass
instruments.
The
vocals
in
many
of
the
songs
appear
louder.
Even
though
there's
a
lot
more
bass,
the
vocals
appear
louder
than
they
did
before,
which
is
usually
something
you
fight
with
when
you
bring
the
bass
up,
the
vocals
disappear.
And
all
of
the
shrill
guitar
parts
have
been
fixed.
The
reason
it's
hard
to
pick
out
specific
instances
is
because
there
literally
isn't
one
second
of
any
song
on
either
of
those
albums
that
wasn't
touched.
[laughs]
At
the
outset
of
Boston,
when
that
first
bass-guitar
note
hits
in
&quot;More
Than
a
Feeling,&quot;
it's
a
lot
fuller
and
a
lot
bigger.
And
when
Brad
starts
singing,
his
voice
is
louder.
It's
hard
to
achieve
that,
especially
when
those
rhythm
power-chord
guitars
are
playing
at
the
beginnings
of
songs,
or
breaks
between
chorus
and
verses,
the
guitars
are
much
more
powerful.
That
power
was
something
that
slipped
through
the
cracks
when
I
was
making
the
original
master
tracks.
It
was
a
mistake.
I
knew
about
it
after
the
fact,
but
back
then,
in
the
'70s,
it
couldn't
be
fixed.
Also,
a
lot
of
cymbals,
lead-guitar
parts,
and
some
vocals
got
very,
very
screechy
in
the
16-bit
product,
and
those
have
all
been
brought
back
into
range.
They
all
now
sound
pretty
good
to
me
on
CD,
and
I
don't
usually
like
the
way
anything
sounds
on
CD.

<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















In
general,
you've
never
been
a
fan
of
digital.














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">I
work
only
in
an
analog
studio,
so
I
hear
music
at
its
very
best.
I
mean,
there's
nothing
like
the
sound
of
an
analog
multitrack
recording
playing
back.
You'll
never
hear
it
sound
so
good
again
because
it
actually
is
the
real
thing.
It's
the
real
music
by
the
real
musicians,
the
phase
hasn't
been
all
screwed
up
by
the
A/D
conversion,
and
the
high
end
isn't
all
messed
up
trying
to
fit
a
16-kHz
tone
into
three
pieces
of
a
44-Hz
sampling
rate.
In
an
analog
studio,
you're
hearing
pristine,
real-world
sound,
the
way
it
would
sound
if
it
was
coming
through
the
mikes,
and
you
were
listening
to
them
in
headphones
right
there
in
your
room.
24-bit
digital
sounds
pretty
good
to
me.
But
as
soon
as
you
make
the
conversion
to
16-bit,
it
sounds
like
crap.
[laughs]
I
have
a
hard
time
listening
to
CDs
after
working
on
an
analog
original
because
of
what
they
do
to
the
depth
perception.
The
phase-angle
errors
caused
by
the
A/D
conversion
really
bother
me.
They
bothered
me
the
very
first
time
I
heard
digital
next
to
an
analog
original.
I
was
always
amazed
that
people
didn't
perceive
that
something
that
once
sounded
like
it
was
located
way
beyond
their
speakers
now
sounded
like
it
was
on
a
flat
plane...</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















All
collapsed,
basically...














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">Yeah.
That's
what
digital
does.
It
changes
the
audio
waveform.
People
think
digital
is
an
accurate
representation
of
music,
and
it's
not.
And
because
of
the
phase-angle
error,
all
the
things
that
your
ear
and
your
brain
do
normally
to
figure
out
where
sounds
are
coming
from
to
form
a
mental
aural
map,
if
you
will,
of
your
audio
surroundings,
it
takes
that
and
completely
fools
it.
It
turns
something
that
had
enormous
depth
and
was
recorded
in
a
natural,
beautiful
hall
and
puts
it
into
a
little
flat
thing
in
front
of
you.
So,
as
you
can
see,
I've
hated
digital
from
the
beginning.
But
it's
cheap,
and
it's
got
a
lot
of
features,
and
that's
what
sells.

tape.

<p><span
class="text"><span

wish!
There
was
nothing
as
good,
and
nothing
ever
will
be,
probably.
But,
in
the
meantime,
I
think
we
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
making
the
adjustments
so
that
those
early
albums
come
across
really
well
on
CD.
And
in
some
ways,
because
of
the
improvements
we
made
in
the
mastering,
I
prefer
the
new
CD
version
over
the
original
vinyl.

<question>















What
compromises
did
you
have
to
make
when
you
originally
mastered
the
album
to
vinyl?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
The
compromises
in
those
days
were
huge.
Every
song
was,
basically,
&quot;Well,
this
is
the
best
we
can
get
with
what
we've
got.&quot;
Even
though
those
mixes
were
done
at
what
was
considered
a
well-equipped
mixing
room
[Westlake
Audio
in
Los
Angeles],
there
was
only
so
much
you
could
do.
We
were
doing
it
manually.
The
outboard
gear
available
for
signal
processing
was
really
crude
by
today's
standards,
so
we
did
the
best
we
could.
But
I
knew
what
I
would
have
done
if
we
hadn't
had
all
those
limitations,
and
I
finally
got
a
chance
to
do
it.
It
was
a
little
more
difficult
working
with
the
2-track
as
opposed
to
being
able
to
take
the
multitrack
and
remix
it,
but
I
think
we
made
enormous
improvements.
The
tracks
have
a
lot
more
power.
That
was
the
thing
I
was
looking
for.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















These
two
albums
are
all
about
power.
I
remember
in
the
days
of
vinyl,
we
just
used
to
turn
them
up
as
loud
as
we
could
go...














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
Sure.
A
little
speaker
distortion
always
helped.
[both
laugh]
Well,
the
differences
in
the
new
masters
aren't
subtle
at
all.
When
you
put
on
album
one
[Boston],
right
away,
you'll
hear
a
difference
in
the
listenability
and
the
impact
of
the
power
chords
and
the
bass
instruments.
It
made
a
world
of
difference
to
me,
listening
to
them.
And
I
think
we
made
even
more
improvements
with
Don't
Look
Back,
the
whole
album.</span></span></p>

<question>















Switching
gears
here,
what's
your
take
on
digital
files
and
iPods?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span

Don't
get
me
started
on
MP3s...</span></span></p>
<p><span

No,

This
is

</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">[laughs]
I'll
just
leave
it
at...
[pauses]
I
hate
them.
People
find
it
hard
to
believe,
but
other
than
the
obvious
noise-floor
considerations,
cassettes
sounded
much
better
than
any
of
this
digital
crap.
For
everyday
use,
I
still
use
constant
quick-reference
mixes
in
the
studio,
different
arrangements,
different
guitar
parts,
different
singing
parts,
different
mix
ideas,
so
I
always
have
a
loaded,
ready-to-go
mix
deck
hooked
up
to
my
stereo
bus.
At
any
moment,
I
can
push
the
button,
record,
and
sit
back
and
A/B
the
different
parts
and
ideas.
If
I
didn't
have
a
cassette
deck
doing
that
job,
I'd
be
lost.
I
was
so
worried
about
it
that
I
bought
a
second
cassette
deck
and
then
I
bought
boxes
and
boxes
of
the
Maxell
tape
that
I
use
since
I
figure
at
some
point
they'll
stop
making
it.
I
depend
on
it
so
heavily.

<question>















There's
nothing
else
that
will
quickly
reproduce
an
accurate
representation
of
sound
to
exacting
standards.














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
Like
you
said,
reel-to-reel
was
the
best,
and
I
always
have
to
put
cassette
right
behind
it,
the
only
thing
being
the
noise-floor
issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















I
remember
Columbia
tapes
back
in
the
day
wearing
out
after
many
repeated
listenings.














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
Right.
Not
only
that,
but
I
used
to
get
half
a
dozen
tapes
of
an
album
and
I'd
put
them
on
one
after
another,
and
the
differences
in
the
EQ
and
the
high
end
between
them
would
be
all
over
the
lot.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















Are
CDs
in
danger
of
becoming
extinct?
Do
you
think
we're
moving
to
a
purely
digital-delivery
age?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
There's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
companies
are
going
to
be
able
to
sell
low-quality
audio
product
in
massive
numbers
far
more
easily
than
they
can
sell
a
true
high-quality
reproduction.
Unfortunately,
people
have
shown
by
their
dollar
votes
that
they
don't
care
about
quality
nearly
as
much
as
they
do
features,
convenience,
and
cost.
It's
a
little
ironic,
because
I
remember
when
I
was
in
school
[in
the
late
'60s],
the
thing
to
do
was
buy
the
parts
or
kits
and
spend
hours
and
hours
building
your
own
amplifiers
and
preamps
and
all
this
stuff
so
that
you
could
get
absolute,
primo,
best
possible
sound.
I
did
it,
and
most
of
the
college
kids
I
knew
did
that.
They
were
the
first
to
embrace
stereo
broadcast
with
full-frequency
reproduction.
Today,
college
kids
are
buying
this
low-grade,
cheap,
kinda
crappy
audio
sound.
It's
bizarre.
I'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
happened.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















To
the
current
generation,
music
is
in
the
background
rather
than
the
foreground.
Growing
up,
we
put
aside
everything
to
listen
to
a
new
album.
People
don't
really
do
that
anymore.














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">
That's
probably
true.
I
suppose
convenience
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it,
too.
Music
production
is
pretty
bad
for
the
delivery
that's
available.
Eventually,
it
could
be
only
something
really
horrible,
like
MP3.
But
there
will
be
a
very
small,
and
very
expensive
alternative,
just
like
there
is
today.
You
can
get
audio
on
a
DVD
that's
at
least
in
24-bit.
And
24-bit
digital
audio
is
not
bad.
So
I
imagine
there
may
be
a
direct
electronic-delivery
system
that
will
be
at
least
24-bit
with
hopefully
a
higher
bit
rate
that
some
people
would
be
willing
to
pay
for,
like
those
who
do
for
half-speed
masters.</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















What
do
you
think
of
surround
sound?














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">Surround
sound
is
nice,
but
what
the
hell
do
you
need
five
speakers
for?
They
did
it
with
four
early
on
in
the
'70s,
quad,
and
it
sounded
awesome.
It
was
four
real
channels
that
people
would
mix
to
using
real
reverberation
and
real
instruments,
not
some
conjured
up,
delayed,
fake
thing
to
give
it
false,
spatial
effects.
It's
fine,
and
it
sounds
neat,
but
what
do
you
need
five
speakers
for?
I'll
take
that
thought
one
step
further:
10
years
after
quad
came
out,
people
were
understanding
sound
interpretation
in
the
human
ear
and
mind
well
enough
to
be
able
to
locate
sound
from
a
pair
of
speakers
anywhere
in
a
room,
and
some
of
it
was
quite
strikingly
good.
For
that,
you
had
to
have
very,
very
good
analog
reproduction,
none
of
this
digital
crap
where
you
change
phase
angles
with
respect
to
frequency,
because
as
soon
as
you
do
that,
you
destroy
it.
It
was
actually
possible
in
the
analog
world
to
have
surround
sound
with
two
speakers.
So
I
look
at
it
and
I
think,
&quot;What
a
scam
for
selling
five
speakers
and
five
channels
of
crap
to
people
for
what
could
have
been
done
with
two
speakers.&quot;
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">














<question>















Actually,
it's
six,
because
you
have
a
separate
sub
channel...














</question>
</span></span></p>
<p><span
class="text"><span
class="text">Of
course...
still,
it's
a
scam,
and
it
sounds
neat,
but
it
can
be
done
with
fewer
components.
I
don't
want
to
sound
overly
cynical,
as
it's
one
of
those
things
you
can
have
fun
with,
but
it's
not
an
eloquent
solution
for
doing
the
job
of
surround.

June
29,
2006<br
/>
Cameron
Graham<br
/>
In
1976,
a
garage
band
called
Boston
released
their
debut
album,
self-titled
Boston.
In
what
is
now
classic
rock
history,
it
took
the
charts
and
the
world
by
storm,
going
to
number
one
and
becoming
the
best
selling
album
of
all
time,
a
title
which
was
held
for
many
years.<br
/>
Two
years
later
and
having
already
catapulted
into
the
classic
rock
pantheon,
Boston
released
their
follow-up
album
Don't
Look
Back.
The
album
was
rush-recorded
at
the
studio's
insistence,
a
far
cry
from
the
seven-year
long
ordeal
that
was
Boston,
which
explains
the
albums
short,
33-minute
running
time.
Both
Boston
albums
have
now
been
remastered
for
the
first
time
each,
by
head
band
member
Tom
Scholz.<br
/>
<br
/>
<i>
Boston</i><br
/>
The
classic
CD.
Consistently
ranked
one
of
the
best
classic
rock
CDs
ever,
although
for
a
while
was
unfairly
criticized
as
&quot;corporate
rock.&quot;
It's
not
hard
to
hear
why
these
accolades
are
laid
on
one
after
the
other.<br
/>
No
matter
how
anti-classic
rock
you
happen
to
be,
it's
hard
not
to
start
tapping
your
feet
and
acknowledging
the
greatness
of
the
classic
beat
from
&quot;More
Than
A
Feeling&quot;
when
listening.
The
vocals
soar
around
you
and
you
realize
that
no
matter
how
many
times
you
hear
the
song,
it
will
never
turn
stale.<br
/>
Next
up
comes
&quot;Peace
Of
Mind,&quot;
a
slightly
faster
song
with
quicker
vocals
and
another
classic
with
great
lyrics
and
guitars.
It's
almost
impossible
in
this
review
to
simply
go
through
the
songs,
as
each
one
is
a
hit.
All
have
been
played
countless
times
and
are
mostly
likely
all
worthy
of
their
own
individual
reviews.<br
/>
The
only
song
that's
not
quite
up
to
par
on
Boston
is
&quot;Rock
N
Roll
Band&quot;
which
seems
more
like
an
echo
of
the
surrounding
songs.
It's
worth
saying
though
that
the
song
isn't
all
that
bad
‚&Auml;&icirc;
in
it's
own
right
it's
a
fine
song
‚&Auml;&icirc;
but
on
an
album
that's
this
good,
it
falls
by
the
wayside
to
some
extent.<br
/>
Probably
the
best
thing
I
can
write
about
Boston
is
this:
If
you
don't
own
it,
there's
no
better
time
to
repent
your
ways
and
buy
this
album.
If
you
do
own
Boston,
there's
no
better
time
to
update
your
old
CD
with
a
new,
remixed,
and
sonically
superior
version.<br
/>
<br
/>
<i>
Don't
Look
Back<br
/>
</i>
While
most
praise
is
generally
directed
towards
their
first
album,
that
doesn't
mean
Boston's
second
outing,
Don't
Look
Back,
is
unworthy
of
attention.
The
name
is
ironic
in
this
case.
What
Boston
is
in
essence
doing
on
this
album
is
not
expanding
into
new
territories
and
instead
further
compacting
and
solidifying
their
unique
style.
While
most
bands
would
be
(and
are)
chastised
for
essentially
staying
put
musically,
it's
tricker
to
do
so
with
Boston
as
the
music
is
just
so
good.<br
/>
The
title
song,
&quot;Don't
Look
Back&quot;,
is
a
Boston
classic
and
deservedly
so,
containing
the
uplifting
tone,
unique
vocal
harmony,
and
guitar
riffs
that
make
the
band
great.
The
overall
feel
to
Don't
Look
Back
is
slightly
slower
paced
than
that
of
Boston
with
songs
such
as
&quot;A
Man
I'll
Never
Be&quot;
and
&quot;Used
To
Bad
News.&quot;<br
/>
There's&not;†a
noticeable
amount
of
filler
material
on
this
disc
(&quot;It's
Easy&quot;
and
&quot;Used
To
Bad
News&quot;)
and
an
instrumental
track
&quot;The
Journey&quot;
that,
even
at
a
short
1
minute
and
46
seconds,
seems
to
drag
on
and
on.
These
flaws
are
probably
due
more
in
part
to
the
rush
recorded
status
of
the
album
rather
than
an
actual
drop
in
quality.<br
/>
Even
with
these
complaints,
it's
worth
owning
the
album
for
the
amazing
times
when
everything
clicks
(which
thankfully
is
fairly
often)
on
tracks
like
&quot;Feelin'
Satisfied,&quot;
&quot;Don't
Be
Afraid,&quot;
and
of
course
&quot;Don't
Look
Back&quot;.
The
sound
quality
is
again
very
good
on
this
new
re-mastered
disc.
Highly
recommended
for
both
Boston
fans
and
those
new
to
the
band
or
classic
rock
in
general.--Sound
and
Vision
magazine's
Vice
President/Editor
in
Chief
Mike
Mettler
recently
did
an
interview
with
Tom
as
well.
He
states,
&quot;You've
never
heard
Boston
and
Don't
Look
Back
like
this
before.
These
remasters
show
just
how
far
ahead
of
his
time
Tom
Scholz
was
(and
still
is)
--
they're
two
of
the
best-sounding
CDs
I've
ever
listened
to.
Run,
don't
walk
(and
don't
look
back!),
and
go
buy
these
two
classic
discs
immediately.
Your
ears
will
be
glad
you
did.<br
/>
<br
/>
I
spent
about
50
minutes
alone
just
on
'More
Than
a
Feeling.'
What
a
difference!
The
bass
on
the
intro
is
indeed
much
fuller.
Brad's
vocals
are
also
much
fuller,
and
even
wider
in
scope.
On
previous
CD
versions,
it's
almost
like
he's
singing
through
water.
The
difference
is
quite
noticeable
when
he
sings
'away'
at
the
0:40
mark,
and
especially
'away
-
hey'
@2:26.
The
drums
are
punchier
(you
can
feel
the
kick
right
in
the
gut),
and
cymbal
and
stickwork
are
crisper.
In
general,
Brad's
vocals
are
a
revelation
throughout
both
albums,
making
me
feel
like
he
was
singing
right
in
front
of
me.
&quot;A
live
interview
with
Tom
will
be
broadcast
in
the
future
at
soundandvisionmag.com
in
the
near
future.

Boston
-
'Boston'
and
'Don't
Look
Back'
-
(Epic/Legacy)<br
/>
Those
who
go
beyond
the
music
and
read
the
liner
notes
of
these
two
reissued
albums
might
laugh
when
the
writer
suggests
a
kinship
between
the
joyous
energy
of
Boston's
radio-friendly
classic
rock
and
Nirvana's
infectious
'90s
hit
&quot;Smells
Like
Teen
Spirit.&quot;<br
/>
Hardcore
fans
of
one
or
the
other
band
might
even
find
the
idea
blasphemous,
but
an
open
mind
will
see
the
truth
to
it.
Beneath
Boston's
polished
layers
of
guitars
and
Nirvana's
stubbornly
distorted
pop-punk
beats
the
same
youthful
exuberance
-
different
decade;
same
idea.
Even
Steve
Jones,
guitarist
for
iconic
punkers
the
Sex
Pistols,
has
admitted
to
secretly
liking
&quot;More
Than
a
Feeling&quot;
at
a
time
when
his
band
was
supposed
to
be
tearing
down
the
&quot;dinosaur
rock&quot;
of
bands
like
Boston.<br
/>
What
Boston
mastermind
Tom
Scholz
and
his
bandmates
did
on
these
two
albums
was
marry
the
youthful
energy
and
concerns
of
early
rock
'n'
roll
to
the
big
sound
of
heroes
such
as
Led
Zepplin,
but
ditching
all
the
mystical
pomp
and
circumstance
of
mid-'70s
hard
rock.
In
a
way,
Boston
was
an
alternative
to
the
alternative,
giving
kids
who
were
turned
off
by
the
rigid
ideology
of
punk
and
the
vapid
pulse
of
disco
a
way
to
rock.<br
/>
Although
there
are
no
bonus
tracks
and
the
liner
notes
will
interest
only
the
historically-minded,
the
updated
sound
quality
alone
makes
this
pair
of
reissues
worthy
of
purchase.<br
