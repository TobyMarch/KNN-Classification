<p>A
Tribe
Called
Quest
is
one
of
Hip
Hops
most
legendary,
beloved
and
revered
groups
of
all
time
and
for
good
reason.
Easily
recognized
for
their
unique
approach
to
rap
music
by
employing
jazz
infused
soundscapes
to
Afro
centric
rhymes,
sans
the
jaded
and
often
nihilistic
aggressive
posturing
associated
with
hip-hop,
A
Tribe
Called
Quest
was
largely
responsible
for
the
popularity
of
a
new
genre
that
dominated
the
East
Coast
sound
of
the
early
1990s.</p>







<p>Queens,
New
York
natives
Q-Tip
,
Phife
Dawg
,
and
Ali
Shaheed
Muhammad
of
Brooklyn,
formed
ATCQ
in
1985.
Jarobi,
the
honorary
member
of
ATCQ,
though
not
always
heard,
was
a
fixture
of
the
group
in
heart
and
in
friendship.
QUEST,
the
original
name
of
the
group,
was
later
given
the
prefix
A
Tribe
Called
by
their
high
school
buddies,
The
Jungle
Brothers,
while
recording
Black
Is
Black
for
their
album
Straight
Out
The
Jungle.
ATCQ,
along
with
the
Jungle
Brothers
and
De
La
Soul,
formed
a
unit
called
The
Native
Tongues.
With
a
building
buzz
around
The
Native
Tongues
and
Tribes
energetic
live
performances,
ATCQ
landed
a
major
recording
contract
with
Jive
Records
in
1989.</p>







<p>Sonically,
ATCQ
was
a
decisive
and
welcomed
tangent
of
jazz,
bass-heavy
rhythmic
vibes
and
eclectic
sampling
when
compared
to
the
mundane
recycling
of
soul
loops,
breaks
and
vocals
of
their
contemporaries.
Lyrically,
emcees
Q-Tip
and
Phife
Dawg
addressed
social
issues
relevant
to
young
blacks
such
as
use
of
the
n
word
and
its
relevance,
date
rape
and
other
interpersonal
relationships,
industry
politics
and
consumerism
with
infectious
energy
and
fun
and
having
a
good
time
while
still
promoting
positivity.</p>







<p>ATCQ
composed
a
number
of
successful
singles
and
albums
with
their
creative
approach
to
rap
music.
In
1990,
the
group
released
Peoples
Instinctive
Travels
and
the
Paths
of
Rhythm,
scoring
several
memorable
songs
including
Bonita
Applebum,
Can
I
Kick
It
and
I
Left
my
Wallet
in
El
Segundo.
It
was
their
sophomore
effort,
The
Low
End
Theory,
considered
one
of
the
greatest
follow-ups
in
hip-hop
history,
that
would
solidify
them
as
legends.
Released
in
late
1991,
the
freedom
expressed
in
the
creation
and
feel
of
this
record
–
along
with
its
successor
Midnight
Marauders
–
influenced
many
future
artists
and
producers
such
as
Common,
The
Roots,
Jill
Scott,
Kanye
West
and
The
Neptunes.
These
artists
are
a
part
of
ATCQs
legacy
and
are
evidence
of
ATCQs
impact
for
years
to
come.
Classics
like
Award
Tour,
Electric
Relaxation,
Check
The
Rhyme
and
Scenario
defined
ATCQs
sound
during
this
period.</p>







<p>In
1996,
ATCQs
fourth
album,
Beats,
Rhymes
&amp;
Life,
was
released.
The
Ummah
–
a
production
team
consisting
of
Q-Tip
,
Ali
Shaheed
and
newcomer
and
stellar
talent
Jay
Dee
(now
Jay
Dilla
of
Slum
Village)
–
was
established
the
same
year.
The
team
worked
together
to
share
their
aural
aesthetic
with
other
artists
like
Janet
Jackson,
DAngelo,
and
Faith
Evans.</p>







<p>ATCQ
continued
to
perfect
and
advance
their
sound,
displaying
their
unique
take
on
hip-hop.
It
was
with
the
completion
of
their
fifth
studio
album,
The
Love
Movement,
that
ATCQ
chose
to
exit
the
proverbial
stage.</p>







<p>In
recent
years,
the
anticipation
for
another
ATCQ
album
has
been
building.
The
Abstract
Poetic,
Five
Foot
Assasin
,
and
Mr.
Muhammad
have
yet
to
grace
the
studio
for
another
record,
but
have
hit
the
road
again.
Today,
the
power
of
their
music
is
still
evident
in
their
dynamic
stage
shows
and
in
the
reception
of
their
adoring
fans.</p>







<p>A
Tribe
Called
Quests
anomalous
posture
has
changed
the
face
and
sound
of
hip-hop
and
paved
the
way
for
future
groups,
artists,
producers
and
even
fans
to
be
unapologetic
about
their
creative
expression.
With
or
without
future
recordings,
ATCQs
legacy
lives
on
in
the
groups
creative
innovation
that
is
recognized
as
a
profound
contribution
to
musical
history.</p>

Dilla
of
Slum
Village)
–
was
established
the
same
year.
The
team
worked
together
to
share
their
aural
aesthetic
with
other
artists
like
Janet
Jackson,
DAngelo,
and
Faith
Evans.</p>







<p>ATCQ
continued
to
perfect
and
advance
their
sound,
displaying
their
unique
take
on
hip-hop.
It
was
with
the
completion
of
their
fifth
studio
album,
The
Love
Movement,
that
ATCQ
chose
to
exit
the
proverbial
stage.</p>







<p>In
recent
years,
the
anticipation
for
another
ATCQ
album
has
been
building.
The
Abstract
Poetic,
Five
Foot
Assasin
,
and
Mr.
Muhammad
have
yet
to
grace
the
studio
for
another
record,
but
have
hit
the
road
again.
Today,
the
power
of
their
music
is
still
evident
in
their
dynamic
stage
shows
and
in
the
reception
of
their
adoring
fans.</p>







<p>A
Tribe
Called
Quests
anomalous
posture
has
changed
the
face
and
sound
of
hip-hop
and
paved
the
way
for
future
groups,
artists,
producers
and
even
fans
to
be
unapologetic
about
their
creative
expression.
With
or
without
future
recordings,
ATCQs
legacy
lives
on
in
the
groups
creative
innovation
that
is
recognized
as
a
profound
contribution
to
musical
history.</p>
