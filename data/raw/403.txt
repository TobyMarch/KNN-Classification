BLACK
STAR
RIDERS







</div>







</div>







<div

&nbsp;</p>








<p
align="center">
<strong>Featuring:</strong></p>








<p
align="center">
<strong>Ricky
Warwick,

<p>
In
October
2012
Thin
Lizzy
announced
that
they
would
not
be
recording
new
material
under
the
Thin
Lizzy
monicker.
The
last
incarnation
of
the
band
-
Scott
Gorham,
Brian
Downey,
Darren
Wharton,
Ricky
Warwick,
Damon
Johnson
and
Marco
Mendoza
–
would
be
looking
to
form
a
new
project.</p>








<p>
Step
forward
Black
Star
Riders…</p>








<p>
Today
sees
the
announcement
of
the
new
band
formed
by
Thin
Lizzy
alumni
Ricky
Warwick
(vocals),
Scott
Gorham
(guitar),
Damon
Johnson
(guitar),
Marco
Mendoza
(bass)
with
new
addition
Jimmy
DeGrasso
on
drums
(Alice
Cooper,
Megadeth,
David
Lee
Roth,
Suicidal
Tendencies).
The
change
in
personnel
came
about
as
Brian
Downey
didn’t
want
to
commit
to
the
touring
cycle
a
new
album
would
entail
and
Darren
Wharton
wanted
to
concentrate
on
Dare
and
other
music
and
film
projects.</p>








<p>
Black
Star
Riders
is
set
to
enter
the
studio
in
Los
Angeles
in
January
2013
to
start
recording
their
debut
album
with
the
legendary
Kevin
Shirley
(Led
Zeppelin,
Iron
Maiden,
Aerosmith,
Rush).
The
album
will
feature
material
the
band
wrote
whilst
touring
as
Thin
Lizzy
and
the
sound
retains
that
classic
feel
but
is
very
much
its
own
as
well.
The
Black
Star
Riders
record
is
the
next
step
in
the
evolution
of
the
Thin
Lizzy
story.</p>








<p>
<em>&quot;We
are
all
very
excited
about
the
music
that
we
have
created
for
Black
Star
Riders.&nbsp;
The
synergy
between
the
five
of
us
has
been
phenomenal
and
I
can't
wait
for
the
world
to
hear
these
songs.&quot;</em>Ricky
Warwick</p>








<p>
The
new,
as
yet
untitled,
album
will
be
released
in
May
2013
through
Nuclear
Blast
–
the
label
behind
acts
such
as
Anthrax,
Nightwish
and
Meshuggah.
Black
Star
Riders
are
one
of
the
first
bands
signed
by
Monte
Conner
–
the
former
Roadrunner
A&amp;R
guru
who
has
signed
acts
such
as
Slipknot,
Machine
Head,
Sepultura
and
Rush.
Conner
recently
joined
Nuclear
Blast
as
the
president
of
Nuclear
Blast
Entertainment,
a
new
U.S.
partnership
he
co-founded
with
Nuclear
Blast
owner
Markus
Staiger.&nbsp;</p>








<p>
Says
Conner:
“As
a
lifelong
Thin
Lizzy
fan,&nbsp;I
was
floored
by
this
line-up’s
new
material.
Not
only
do
the
new
songs
sound
like
Thin
Lizzy
but
they
sound
like
CLASSIC
Thin
Lizzy.
Black
Star
Riders
totally
captures
the
essence
of
what
was
great
about
the
original
band
while
at
the
same
time
adding
something
totally
fresh
and
modern.
Even
when
I
heard
the
band
decided
to
change
their
name,
my
interest
in
signing
them&nbsp;did
not
waver
for
one
second.”</p>








<p>
The
band
are
looking
to
support
their
May
album
release
with
European
festivals
shows
in
the
summer
of
2013
and
follow
this
up
with
worldwide
touring.
The
set
list
will
consist
of
material
from
the
new
album
and
classic
Thin
Lizzy
material.</p>

<p>
THE
WORLD’S
BIGGEST
ROCK
BANDS
ON
ONE
STAGE<br
/>
Rock’n’roll
doesn’t
get
any
bigger
than
this!<br
/>
KISS
and
M&ouml;tley
Cr&uuml;e.
On
the
same
stage.
On
the
same
night.<br
/>
It‘s
the
news
Australian
fans
have
been
waiting
for
with
the
spectacle
of
all
spectacles
announced
today,
KISS
with
very
special
guests
M&ouml;tley
Cr&uuml;e
will
tour
Australia
in
March
2013.<br
/>
Presented
by
McManus
Entertainment,
the
summer’s
biggest,
baddest
rock
tour
will
hit
Sydney,
Brisbane,
Melbourne,
Perth,
Mackay
and
Adelaide
with
guests
Irish
rockers
Thin
Lizzy
along
for
the
ride
(*except
Adelaide).<br
/>
KISS
and
M&ouml;tley
Cr&uuml;e’s
45
show
US
summer
tour
has
already
gone
down
as
one
helluva
rock’n’roll
extravaganza
and
now,
finally,
its
Australia’s
turn!<br
/>
Not
only
has
it
been
five
long
years
since
KISS
last
toured
Australia,
but
2013
marks
a
very
special
milestone
for
this
great
band
–
their
40th
anniversary.
In
all
their
bombastic
and
unstoppable
glory,
KISS
will
perform
fan
favorites
from
their
treasure-trove
of
hits
along
with
tracks
from
their
just–released
20th
studio
album
‘Monster’,
which
debuted
at
#7
on
the
ARIA
Charts.
Gene
Simmons
and
Paul
Stanley,
with
longtime
members
guitarist
Tommy
Thayer
and
drummer
Eric
Singer,
are
at
the
top
of
their
game
on
‘Monster’,
which
embodies
all
that
is
KISS
and
the
music
that
first
inspired
them
to
pick
up
their
guitars
and
flame-throwers
and
don
makeup
to
entertain
millions.<br
/>
M&ouml;tley
Cr&uuml;e
last
toured
here
last
year,
but
let’s
face
it,
we
can’t
get
enough
of
the
Crue!
They’ve
recently
become
the
first
rock
band
in
history
to
play
an
epic
sold-out
Las
Vegas
residency
at
The
Joint
at
Hard
Rock
Hotel
&amp;
Casino.
The
band
is
best
known
for
continuing
to
reinvent
not
only
their
live
show
(with
mind
blowing
elements
such
as
Tommy
Lee’s
360
drum
roller
coaster)
and
music
(brand
new
song
due
out
soon),
but
remain
on
the
cutting
edge
via
social

<p>
This
Thin
Lizzy
book
has
come
through
an
awfully
long
gestation
period!
Back
in
1977,
Phil
Lynott
asked
me
to
write
the
book
and
interviews
were
conducted
in
Toronto
where
I
spent
a
month
with
the
band
while
they
recorded
„Bad
Reputation.
After
that,
it
was
delayed
as
we
tried
to
continuously
update
it
during
the
subsequent
albums,
but
Phil
Lynott
would
never
come
clean
with
his
increasing
drug
use.
In
fact,
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
once:
„Harry,
I
don‚t
take
drugs
anymore‰.<br
/>
<br
/>
But
during
the
period,
they
continued
to
prove
that
they
were
one
of
the
most
potent
rock
bands
in
the
world,
growing
from
humble
roots
in
Dublin
with
a
few
early
albums
that
verged
on
folk-rock,
and
then
recording
the
innovative,
Vagabonds
of
the
Western
World,
with
its
orchestral
guitars,
fine
songs
and
arrangements,
and,
of
course,
Lynott‚s
unique
voice.<br
/>
<br
/>
But
it
was
after
the
band
lost,
first,
Eric
Bell,
and
briefly
afterwards,
Gary
Moore,
that
they
really
came
into
their
own,
in
what
has
been
called
The
Golden
Era
of
Thin
Lizzy.
With
two
new
guitarists,
Scott
Gorham
and
Brian
Robertson,
they
set
upon
an
unprecedented
set
of
albums
and
touring,
culminating
in
what
has
been
voted
the
Best
Live
Album
of
all
time,
Live
and
Dangerous.<br
/>
<br
/>
Then,
of
course,
the
guitar
curse
struck
again,
Robertson
out
/
Moore
back
in
/
Moore
out
/
Robertson
back
in,
until
they
settled
on
blues
maestro
Snowy
White,
who
had
cut
his
teeth
with
Pink
Floyd.
White
quit
after
two
albums
when
he
grew
tired
of
the
drug
use
by
Lynott
and
Gorham,
leaving
the
door
open
for
another
young
guitarist
to
enter.
John
Sykes
was
known
primarily
as
a
heavy
metal
player,
and
he
brought
that
heaviness
to
one
album,
Thunder
and
Lightning.<br
/>
<br
/>
But
the
end
was
nigh,
and
when
it
came,
it
really
crashed
down,
tragically.
When
Phil
died,
I
finished
a
first
draft
of
the
book,
on
the
proviso
that
I
would
be
able
to
tell
the
whole
story,
and
if
any
one
person
from
the
band
or
their
families
objected,
I
wouldn‚t
publish
it.
It
was
all
very
dark
and
too
close
to
Phil‚s
death.
A
few
people
flinched
at
the
„warts
and
all‰
detail,
including
Scott
Gorham
and
his
wife,
Christine,
and
the
singer‚s
mother,
Philomena.<br
/>
<br
/>
So
at
last
we
have
the
full
story,
the
tale
of
a
band
that
never
knew
when
to
stop
and
what
to
stop.
This
is
Thin
Lizzy,
from
beginning
to
end.<br
/>

Doherty</p>

<p>
From
a
shaky
start
in
Dublin
in
the
late
sixties,
Thin
Lizzy
was
to
become
one
of
the<br
/>
20th
century‚s
great
rock
bands.
The
story
of
their
ascent
is
wild
and
riveting,
and
here
for
the<br
/>
first
time
it
is
told
from
inside
the
band
by
their
guitarist
Scott
Gorham
and
rock
journalist<br
/>
Harry
Doherty,
who
toured
with
the
band
and
interviewed
them
extensively
from
the
early
days.<br
/>
There
are
also
contributions
from
road
crew,
management
and
friends.<br
/>
In
1969
Phil
Lynott
and
Brian
Downey
were
approached
by
two
former
members
of<br
/>
Van
Morrison's
band
to
form
a
new
group.
Thin
Lizzy
was
born,
a
group
notionally
led
by<br
/>
Lynott
that
would
see
a
dizzying
turnover
of
personnel
as
it
took
rock
and
the
life
style
that<br
/>
came
with
it
to
new
levels.<br
/>
Record
success
eluded
them
until
the
early
seventies
when
Decca
released
their
Whisky
In
The
Jar‚,<br
/>
a
track
already
deemed
unrepresentative
of
the
band
by
Thin
Lizzy
themselves.
It
became
a
huge<br
/>
international
hit
and
the
albums
Jailbreak
and
Live
And
Dangerous
carried
the
band
to<br
/>
the
top
of
the
charts
just
as
they
were
about
to
become
bankrupt.<br
/>
The
wild
life
continued
unabated
with
stories
of
sex,
drink
and
drugs,
band
member
defections,<br
/>
label
switches
and
non-stop
touring
that
took
its
toll
on
everybody
involved.
Phil
Lynott
died<br
/>
aged
36
but
by
then
Thin
Lizzy
was
already
a
legend.
This
is
Scott
Gorham's
account
of
how<br
/>
the
whole
remarkable
spectacle
played
out.</p>

the
Thin
Lizzy
story
in
new
book!







</div>

<div
class="storycontent">







<p>
One
of
the
defining
rock
groups
of
the
20th
Century,
Thin
Lizzy
began
life
in
Dublin
in
1969
when
childhood
friends
Phil
Lynott
and
Brian
Downey
were
approached
by
two
former
members
of
Van
Morrison's
band
'Them',
Eric
Wrixon
(keyboards)
and
Eric
Bell
(guitar).
Now
for
the
first
time,
their
story
is
told
by
guitarist
Scott
Gorham
and
rock
journalist
Harry
Doherty,
who
interviews
and
toured
with
the
band
extensively.
The
band's
story
is
told
by
the
people
who
were
involved
directly
including
former
guitarists,
road
crew,
management,
family
and
friends.
Their
origins
in
Dublin
as
a
three
piece
with
the
Whiskey
in
the
Jar
single
and
a
string
of
unsuccessful
but
highly
creative
albums.
The
move
to
London
to
chase
the
dream
of
being
a
major
rock
band.
The
chaotic
arrival
and
departures
of
various
members
including
Eric
Bell
(who
left
the
band
mid
concert),
Irish
guitarist
Gary
Moore,
Brian
Robertson
and
co-author
Scott
Gorham.
How
the
albums
Jailbreak
and
Boys
Are
Back
in
Town
took
the
band
to
the
top
of
the
charts
just
as
they
were
to
become
bankrupt.
Includes
stories
of
the
band
on
the
road,
the
drink
and
drugs
and
how
the
years
of
partying,
drug-taking
and
non
stop
touring
eventually
took
its
toll
on
not
only
the
band
members
but
on
their
families.
The
death
of
front
man
Phil
Lynott
and
their
legacy
following
his
death.<br
/>
Harry
Doherty
was
asked
to
write
the
book
in
1977
but
for
one
reason
or
another
(usually
to
do
with
drugs),
it
never
happened.
However,
Scott
Gorham
and
Doherty
were
determined
that
a
quality
book
reflecting
the
story
of
the
band
and
their
highly
visual
impact,
would
be
published.
With
their
involvement
in
every
step
of
production,
this
is
the
book,
with
photographs
by
the
band's
official
photographer
that
have
not
be
seen
in
years,
Denis
O'Regan,
who
shot
the
band
as

photographer
and

inception
of

THIN
LIZZY
ANNOUNCE
‘FAREWELL’
TO
TOURING
&amp;
NEW
ALBUM







</div>







</div>







<div
class="storycontent">







<p>
After
a
very
successful
2
year
run
with
the
current
line
up.
Thin
Lizzy
have
made
a
decision
to
not
release
a
new
album
under
the
Thin
Lizzy
name.</p>








<p>
Scott
Gorham
&quot;Out
of
respect
to
Phil
Lynott
and
the
legacy
he
created,
we
have
decided
that
we
should
not
release
a
new
album
under
the
Thin
Lizzy
name.
It
was
a
very
difficult
decision
as
we
put
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
into
re-building
the
Thin
Lizzy
brand
over
recent
years.&nbsp;
Releasing
a
new
album
was
the
only
way
to
continue
this
success.
We
all
know
how
much
Phil
meant
to
this
band
and
the
fans.
We
have
written
20
songs
that
we
all
feel
very
strongly
do
the
band
and
Thin
Lizzy
name
credit.&nbsp;
We
believe
Phil
would
have
been
proud
of
them.&nbsp;
We
always
knew
a
new
record
was
a
touchy
subject
with
some
people
and
as
such
really
want
the
quality
of
these
songs
to
be
heard
by
everyone
without
any
judgment
or
prejudice.
To
that
end,
we
have
decided
not
to
release
these
songs
under
the
name
Thin
Lizzy.&nbsp;
We
want
to
thank
everyone
for
their
support
and
encouragement
over
the
years
and
to
all
our
fans.&nbsp;
We
will
release
this
material
soon
and
you
will
be
hearing
some
great
new
music
with
the
classic
Thin
Lizzy
sound
intact.&nbsp;
We
will
announce
future
plans
early
in
the
new
year.&quot;</p>








<p>
Ricky
Warwick
&quot;Our
plan
always
was
to
put
out
new
music
to
keep
the
name
Thin
Lizzy
alive
and
fresh
with
all
the
band’s
fans
–
old
and
new.
Nobody
respects
Phil
as
much
as
I
do
and
singing
his
songs
for
the
past
2
years
has
been
an
incredible
honor
and
something
I
will
never
forget.
Our
plan
was
to
always
keep
the
band
on
top
of
their
game,
with
great
shows
and
great
production
to
honor
all
that
was
Phil
Lynott
and
his
iconic
body
of
work.&nbsp;
Without
a
new
album
to
gain
new
press
and
keep
the
momentum
we
have
built
up
over
the
past
two
years,
we
are
worried
the
Thin
Lizzy
brand
and
all
it
stands
for
will
diminish
to
a
point
we
would
never
want
to
see.&nbsp;
Therefore
our
regular
touring
as
Thin
Lizzy
will
cease
at
the
end
of
this
year
after
our
European
tour.
I
do
want
to
stress
that
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
we
will
never
play
together
again
as
Thin
Lizzy.
If
there
are
options
for
other
parts
of
the
World,
in
territories
that
this
line
up
has
never
visited
then,
we
may
still
play
odd
shows
in
2013
and
beyond
if
people
want
to
see
us.&quot;</p>








<p>
From
all
the
band
and
associated
personnel,
we
THANK
EVERYONE
OF
OUR
FANS
&amp;
SUPPORTERS
for
making
these
past
2
years
so
incredible
and
we
look
forward
to
seeing
you
all
on
the
Nov
/
Dec
Tour

DUBLIN
RETURN
-
Philo
Exhibition
Returns
to
Dublin
from
London's
O2,
Thursday,
July
19







</div>

<div
class="storycontent">







<p>
Following
a
highly
successful
London
O2
run,&nbsp;<i>Still
In
Love
With
You:
The
Philip
Lynott
Exhibition</i>&nbsp;returns
to
the
Stephen's
Green
Shopping
Centre
in
Dublin,
Thursday
July
19,
where
it
previously
ran,
with
huge
success,
for
a
staggering
eight
months.&nbsp;<br
/>
<br
/>
The
highly
acclaimed
exhibition,
which
brought
visitors
to
Dublin
from
all
over
the
world
last
year,
garnering
rave
reviews
along
the
way,
will
now
return
to
Dublin
for
the
months
of
July,
August
and
September
2012,
with
a
programme
of
events
being
lined
up
to
bring
additional
fun
and
entertainment
to
the
run.&nbsp;<br
/>
<br
/>
As
lead
singer
with
the
legendary
Thin
Lizzy,
Philip
Lynott's
powerful
music
reverberated
around
the
world.
The
Philip
Lynott
Exhibition
attracted
tens
of
thousands
visitors
to
Dublin
and
London
from
Russia,
Germany,
France,
Spain,
Italy,
Sweden,
Norway,
Denmark,
Serbia,
Japan,
Brazil,
Argentina,
the
USA,
Canada
and
many
more
countries
across
the
globe,
as
well
as
from
all
over
the
UK
and
Ireland.&nbsp;<br
/>
<br
/>
Now,
in
&quot;Still
In
Love
With
You
–
The
Philip
Lynott
Exhibition&quot;,
rock
enthusiasts,
music
fans,
families
and
visitors
to
Dublin
alike
can
get
another
opportunity
to
take
what
is
an
emotional
and
inspiring
journey
through
the
life
and
times,
the
music
and
the
memories
of
a
phenomenal
rock
star
and
romantic.<br
/>
<br
/>
Along
with
guitars,
basses
and
other
equipment
used
by
Philip
Lynott,
tour
jackets
worn
by
the
singer,
flight
cases,
his
personal
diary,
lyric
books,
school
reports
and
Lynott's
shares
in
Manchester
United
Football
Club
will
all
be
on
display
–
as
well
as
personal
letters,
cards
and
dozens
of
other
unique
items.&nbsp;<br
/>
&nbsp;<br
/>
The
Philip
Lynott
Exhibition
also
features
a
huge
amount
of
new
material
from
the
archives
of
Hot
Press,
as
well
as
additional
photographs,
original
paintings
and
other
exclusive
artwork.
There
are
video
installations
and
other
audio-visual
material,
including
tributes
from
Bono,
Imelda
May,
Brian
Downey
of
Thin
Lizzy
and
many
more.&nbsp;<br
/>
<br
/>
The
Exhibition
features
an
additional
treasure
trove
of
items,
which
were
added
just
before
its
last
run
ended.
Chief
among
these
is
Lynott's
personal
diary
for
1972,
which
was
recently
unearthed
by
former
Lizzy
tour
manager
Frank
Murray,
as
well
as
personal
material
from
Philip's
childhood
and
hand-written
song
lyrics.<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;There
is
something
really
special
about
this
exhibition,&quot;
Hot
Press
editor
Niall
Stokes
said.
&quot;It
is
hugely
entertaining
and
informative
–
but
it
also
packs
a
real
emotional
impact,
which
is
why
the
response
to
it
has
been
so
universally
positive.
It
is
an
extraordinary
story
of
an
extraordinary
Irishman.<br
/>
<br
/>
<font
color="#060022">&quot;We
extended
the
original
run
twice,&quot;
Stokes
added,
&quot;but
there
are
still
huge
numbers
of
people
that
haven't
been
able
to
make
it
along
yet,
and
who
desperately
want
to
see
the
exhibition
–
so
it's
great
that
we
have
been
able
to
bring
it
back
to
where
it
all
started.&nbsp;<br
/>
<br
/>
&quot;A
lot
of
the
interest
has
come
from
overseas,
with
people
who've
travelled
to
Dublin
to
see
the
exhibition
spreading
the
word.
We've
got
so
many
emails
and
letters
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
'no'
when
we
were
approached
about
giving
it
another
run
here
in
Dublin.&quot;</font><br
/>
<br
/>
The
Philip
Lynott
Exhibition
returns
to
The
Exhibition
Space,
Stephen's
Green
Shopping
Centre
in
Dublin
from
the
O2
in
London
from
July
19
–
September
30,
2012.
The
exhibition
is
home
to
the
biggest
ever
collection
of
memorabilia,
song
lyrics,
exhibits,
paintings,
tributes
and
photographs
of
the
late
rock
legend.
