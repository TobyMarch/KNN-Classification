Young</a>
(vocals,
guitar;
born

1945)</strong></p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">Buffalo
Springfield
was
an
American
supergroup
that
didn’t
exist
long
enough
to
be
recognized
as
such.
Though
the
band’s
tenure
was
short,
Buffalo
Springfield
was
a
pivotal
rock
group
with
an
organic,
home-grown
musical
approach
that
reverberated
beyond
the
Sixties.
Along
with
<a
title="Discover
more
about
The
Byrds"
href="http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-byrds/">the
Byrds</a>,
Buffalo
Springfield
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
folk-rock
and
country-rock
genres
that
took
root
in
the
Seventies.
They
produced
two
of
rock’s
greatest
guitarists
in
<a
title="Discover
more
about
Neil
Young"
href="http://rockhall.com/inductees/neil-young/">Neil
Young</a>
and
Stephen
Stills.
Their
three
albums
–
<em>Buffalo
Springfield,
Buffalo
Springfield
Again</em>
and
<em>Last
Time
Around
–</em>&nbsp;wove
together
strands
of
folk,
country,
pop,
soul
and
rock.
Buffalo
Springfield
also
recorded
one
of
rock’s
greatest
topical
songs,
“For
What
It’s
Worth.”
A
cautionary
number
inspired
by
clashes
between
police
and
youthful
protesters
on
Los
Angeles’
Sunset
Strip,
it
was
the
only
Buffalo
Springfield
single
to
make
the
Top
40,
reaching
Number
Seven
in
1967.</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">The
five
original
members
of
Buffalo
Springfield
converged
on
California
from
different
backgrounds
and
locales.
Guitarists
Stephen
Stills
and
Richie
Furay
had
been
members
of
the
Au
Go-Go
Singers,
a
nine-member
folk
group.
Furay
had
been
born
in
Ohio
and
had
attended
Otterbein
College.
He
then
went
to
New
York,
where
he
initially
played
in
a
folk
trio
before
joining
the
Au
Go-Go
Singers.
Stills
had
attended
the
University
of
Florida,
where
he
was
a
political
science
major,
but
he
dropped
out
of
college
and
went
to
New
York
City
to
pursue
his
love
of
music.
Shortly
after
his
arrival,
he
also
joined
the
Au
Go-Go
Singers.
The
group
recorded
one
record
and,
in
1964,
did
a
tour
that
took
them
across
the
United
States
and
into
Canada.
In
Winnipeg,
the
group
played
with
a
band
called
Neil
Young
and
the
Squires.</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">Guitarist
Young
had
been
born
in
Toronto.
He
started
playing
in
bands
when
he
was
in
the
ninth
grade,
inspired
by
the
music
of
<a
href="/inductees/elvis-presley/">Elvis
Presley</a>.
After
breaking
up
the
Squires,
he
went
to
Detroit
,
where
he
was
in
a
band
called
the
Mynah
Birds,
a
group
built
around
singer
Rick
James
(later,
a
funk-soul
superstar).
The
Mynah
Birds
also
included
another
Canadian,
bassist
Bruce
Palmer.
Young
and
Palmer
soon
decided
to
re-locate
to
Los
Angeles,
where
they
had
little
success
until
Young
happened
to
run
into
Stills.
The
two
decided
to
form
a
band
with
Palmer.
They
then
added
Richie
Furay,
after
he
came
to
L.A.
to
visit
Stills.
The
final
member
of
the
lineup
was
Dewey
Martin,
another
Canadian,
who
had
spent
time
in
Nashville,
where
he
played
with
the
Dillards
and
many
other
artists.</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">A
mere
week’s
worth
of
rehearsals
preceded
their
first
gig.
Buffalo
Springfield,
which
initially
went
by
the
name
the
Herd,
quickly
gelled
into
a
unit
whose
tight,
energetic
live
shows
at
the
Whisky
a
Go-Go,
where
they
held
down
a
magical
six-week
residency,
are
the
stuff
of
rock
and
roll
legend.</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">The
group,
which
took
its
name
from
a
steamroller,
signed
with
Atlantic
Records
in
1966.
Buffalo
Springfield’s
first
single,
released
on
Atlantic’s
Atco
label
in
August
1966,
was
the
Neil
Young
song
“Nowadays
Clancy
Can’t
Even
Sing.”
It
made
the
Top
10
in
Los
Angeles
and
was
a
regional
hit.
They
followed
that
in
December
with
the
Stills-penned
“For
What
It’s
Worth.”&nbsp;
“When
I
write
about
something
like
that,”
Stills
said,
“I’m
separating
myself
from
the
whole
thing.
I’m
an
observer
because
I’m
a
songwriter,
and
I’m
here
to
spread
the
news,
like
the
minstrels
of
the
15<sup>th</sup>
Century.
And
the
news
is
that
the
straight
world
has
been
getting
worse
and
worse
since
World
War
II.
Those
boys
that
won
the
world
by
fire
were
great,
but
now
they’re
trying
to
do
it
again.
Except
they’re
going
to
lose
this
time,
because
the
fire’s
too
big.”
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">Later
in
1967,
Buffalo
Springfield
had
some
more
regional
success
with
two
songs
written
by
Stills,
“Bluebird”
and
“Rock
‘n’
Roll
Woman.”
The
group
boasted
an
almost
uncontainable
pool
of
talent.
Stills,
Young
and
Furay
were
all
formidable
writers,
guitarists
and
vocalists.
However,
they
were
also
very
strong-willed
individuals.</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal">When
bassist
Palmer
got
deported
to
Canada
following
a
drug
bust,
producer
Jim
Messina
–
himself
a
singer
and
guitarist
with
a
predilection
for
country-
and
folk-flavored
rock
–
joined
the
band.
Internecine
squabbles,
particularly
between
Stills
and
Young,
led
to
Buffalo
Springfield’s
disbanding,
but
not
before
they’d
recorded
three
classic
albums
that
sketched
a
number
of
directions
rock
would
follow
in
their
wake.
It
would
be
hard
to
imagine
the
careers
of

Eagles</a>,
<a

and
others
without
Buffalo
Springfield
as
a
precursor,
and
the
roots
of
the
popular
Americana
movement
can
be
found
here,
as
well.
However,
the
prolific
solo
careers
of
<a

Young"
href="http://rockhall.com/inductees/neil-young/">Neil
Young</a>,
Stephen
Stills
and
Richie
Furay,
and
the

–&nbsp;<a

href="http://rockhall.com/inductees/crosby-stills-and-nash/">Crosby,

(and
sometimes
Young),
Poco
and
Loggins
and
Messina
–
are
the
larger,
ongoing
legacy
of
Buffalo
Springfield.</p>






<p
class="MsoNormal"><a
title="Discover
more
about
Neil
Young"
href="http://rockhall.com/inductees/neil-young/">Neil
Young</a>
included
a
nostalgic
song
about
his
old
band,
entitled
“Buffalo
Springfield
Again,”
on
his
2000
album,
<em>Silver
and
Gold</em>,
raising
speculation
that
some
sort
of
reunion
might
be
in
the
offing.
However,
the
deaths
of
Palmer,
in
2004,
and
Martin,
in
2009,
prevented
a
reunion
of
the
original
lineup.
But
in
2010,
Young,
Stills
and
Furay
got
back
together
to
play
the
annual
Bridge
School
benefit
concert
in
California.
The
following
year,
the
three
musicians
–
joined
by
drummer
Joe
Vitale
and
bassist
Rick
Rosas
–
played
six
shows
in
Oakland,
California,
followed
by
shows
in
Los
Angeles
and
Santa
Barbara.
They
also
played
the
Bonnaroo
Music
and
Arts
festival
in
Tennessee
that
year.
Then,
in
2012,
Furay
said
that
no
further
reunions
were
planned.</p>
