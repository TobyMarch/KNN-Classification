<p><br
/>Initially
pegged
as
something
as
a
voice
of
a
generation
when
&quot;Loser&quot;
turned
into
a
smash
crossover
success,
Beck
did
wind
up
crystallizing
much
of
the
postmodern
ruckus
of
the
'90s
alternative
explosion,
but
in
unexpected
ways.
Based
in
the
underground
anti-folk
and
noise
rock
worlds,
Beck
encompassed
all
manner
of
modern
music,
drawing
in
hip-hop,
blues,
trash
rock,
pop,
soul,
lounge
music...pretty
much
any
found
sound
or
vinyl
dug
up
from
a
dusty
crate,
blurring
boundaries
and
encapsulating
how
'90s
hipsters
looked
toward
the
future
by
foraging
through
the
past.
In
another
time,
Beck
may
have
stayed
the
province
of
the
underground,
but
he
surfaced
just
as
alternative
rock
turned
mainstream,
with
his
1994
debut
Mellow
Gold
launching
&quot;Loser,&quot;
a
hit
that
crossed
over
with
the
velocity
of
a
novelty,
a
notion
Beck
quickly
punctured
with
a
succession
of
indie
LPs
delivered
in
the
wake
of
Mellow
Gold,
including
the
lo-fi
folk
of
One
Foot
in
the
Grave,
delivered
on
the
K
imprint.
But
the
album
that
truly
cemented
Beck's
place
in
the
pantheon
was
1996's
Odelay,
a
co-production
with
the
Dust
Brothers
that
touched
upon
all
of
his
obsessions,
providing
a
cultural
keystone
for
the
decade
while
telegraphing
all
his
future
moves,
from
the
soul
prankster
of
Midnite
Vultures
to
the
melancholy
troubadour
of
Sea
Change.
<br
/>
<br
/>Fittingly,
Beck
came
from
a
distinctly
artistic
background,
the
son
of
string
arranger/conductor
David
Campbell
and
Bibbe
Hansen,
a
regular
at
Andy
Warhol's
Factory
whose
father
was
a
pivotal
contributor
to
the
Fluxus
art
movement.
Adopting
the
Hansen
surname
after
his
father
left,
Beck
grew
up
in
Los
Angeles,
dropping
out
of
school
in
the
tenth
grade
to
play
as
a
street
busker
and
attend
poetry
slams.
Bashing
out
blues
and
folk,
Beck
wound
up
assembling
a
home
tape
called
The
Banjo
Story
before
departing
for
New
York,
where
he
operated
on
the
margins
of
the
anti-folk
scene
without
ever
breaking
into
it.
<br
/>
<br
/>He
returned
to
Los
Angeles,
where
he
continued
to
play
clubs,
eventually
gaining
the
attention
of
Bong
Load
Records,
an
independent
operated
by
Tom
Rothrock
and
Rob
Schnapf.
All
parties
agreed
to
pair
Beck's
fledgling
folk
with
hip-hop
beats
assembled
by
producer
Karl
Stephenson,
whose
kitchen
provided
the
studio
for
their
first
efforts,
including
&quot;Loser.&quot;
These
tapes
remained
unreleased
as
Beck
recorded
an
album's
worth
of
material
with
Calvin
Johnson
for
the
latter's
K
label,
but
the
first
release
Beck
had
was
the
Flipside
single
&quot;MTV
Makes
Me
Want
to
Smoke
Crack&quot;
and
Sonic
Enemy's
cassette
release
of
Golden
Feelings.
But
what
really
broke
the
doors
open
was
Bong
Load's
12&quot;
single
of
&quot;Loser,&quot;
which
garnered
considerable
play
in
L.A.,
coinciding
with
increased
underground
attention.
Soon,
Beck
signed
with
Geffen,
striking
a
deal
that
allowed
him
to
release
on
independent
labels.
One
of
these
immediately
followed
--
Fingerpaint
released
a
10&quot;
record
A
Western
Harvest
Field
by
Moonlight
in
January
1994
--
before
the
Geffen
debut
Mellow
Gold
appeared
in
March
of
1994.
<br
/>
<br
/>Naturally,
&quot;Loser&quot;
was
the
lead
single
from
Mellow
Gold
and
it
turned
into
an
instant
smash,
boasting
a
hook
that
worked
as
an
ironic
underground
rallying
cry
and
a
novelty
crossover.
Despite
many
positive
reviews,
Beck
worked
overtime
to
dispel
the
notion
he
was
a
novelty,
quickly
releasing
two
indie
albums
in
succession:
the
noise-skronk
Stereopathetic
Soul
Manure
and
One
Foot
in
the
Grave.
Stereopathetic
made
few
waves,
but
the
stripped-back,
folky
One
Foot
in
the
Grave
acted
as
a
counterbalance
to
the
gonzo
Mellow
Gold,
illustrating
the
depths
of
his
talents.
<br
/>
<br
/>After
a
furious
1994,
Beck
laid
relatively
low
in
1995,
touring
with
the
fifth
Lollapalooza
in
between
working
on
a
new
album
with
the
production
team
the
Dust
Brothers,
who
had
collaborated
with
the
Beastie
Boys
on
their
landmark
1989
Paul's
Boutique.
The
resulting
album,
Odelay,
appeared
in
June
1996,
preceded
by
the
lanky,
funky
single
&quot;Where
It's
At,&quot;
which
would
go
on
to
win
the
Grammy
for
Best
Male
Rock
Vocal.
Odelay
piled
up
acclaim
and
hits
--
&quot;Devil's
Haircut,&quot;
&quot;Jack-Ass,&quot;
and
&quot;The
New
Pollution&quot;
all
charted
around
the
world
--
and
the
record
went
double
platinum,
becoming
a
touchstone
of
'90s
alternative
rock.
An
outtake
from
the
album,
&quot;Deadweight,&quot;
appeared
on
the
soundtrack
to
Danny
Boyle's
1997
film
A
Life
Less
Ordinary,
then
Beck
set
to
work
on
his
next
album
with
producer
Nigel
Godrich,
who
had
just
worked
with
Radiohead
on
OK
Computer.
Their
collaboration,
originally
slated
for
an
indie
release
but
moved
to
Geffen,
thereby
setting
a
precedent
where
no
future
Beck
LP
would
be
released
on
an
indie
(something
worked
out
in
the
courts
the
following
year),
traded
futuristic
rock
--
either
the
joyous
collage
of
Odelay
or
the
dystopia
of
OK
Computer
--
for
a
quiet,
pulsating,
psychedelic
folk-rock
album
called
Mutations.
Riding
high
on
Odelay,
the
album
charted
well
without
turning
out
any
major
hits,
although
it
did
garner
a
Grammy
for
Best
Alternative
Music
Performance.
<br
/>
<br
/>Beck
took
another
abrupt
change
in
musical
direction
in
1999
with
Midnite
Vultures,
a
garish
party
record
that
was
part
satire
and
part
salute
to
soul
and
funk,
particularly
Prince.
Reviews
were
divided
between
ecstatic
and
skeptical,
but
the
album
had
some
real
hits
with
&quot;Sexx
Laws&quot;
and
&quot;Deborah,&quot;
and
in
some
ways
it
was
the
apex
of
Beck's
hipster
prankster
phase,
a
persona
he
shed
with
his
next
album,
2002's
Sea
Change.
Recorded
in
the
wake
of
a
romantic
breakup,
Sea
Change
was
another
Godrich
production,
but
it
was
gentle
and
mournful,
lacking
some
of
the
gritty
underpinnings
of
Mutations
yet
retaining
the
psychedelia
--
and
that
psychedelic
edge
was
brought
out
in
the
supporting
tour
when
Beck
hired
the
Flaming
Lips
as
his
supporting
band.
The
tour
was
well
received
but
there
were
some
tensions,
as
reported
by
Lips
leader
Wayne
Coyne
later.
<br
/>
<br
/>After
an
extended
break
--
the
longest
he
had
taken
between
albums
to
date
--
Beck
returned
in
2005
with
Guero,
an
album
that
reunited
him
with
the
Dust
Brothers
and
consciously
evoked
Odelay.
Guero
launched
a
few
hits,
including
&quot;E-Pro&quot;
and
&quot;Hell
Yes,&quot;
and
was
followed
within
months
by
Guerolito,
a
remixed
version
of
the
entire
album.
Beck
continued
in
this
direction
the
following
year
with
The
Information,
but
its
Nigel
Godrich
production
kept
the
album
streamlined
and
emphasized
the
darker
undercurrents
in
the
songs.
Some
of
that
darkness
could
be
heard
on
his
eighth
album,
Modern
Guilt,
a
2008
release
produced
by
Danger
Mouse,
marking
his
first
time
in
14
years
that
he
worked
with
a
producer
who
wasn't
the
Dust
Brothers
or
Godrich.
<br
/>
<br
/>Modern
Guilt
performed
respectably
--
it
debuted
at
eight
on
the
U.S.
Billboard
charts
and
received
strong
reviews
--
but
Beck
spent
the
next
several
years
relatively
quiet.
In
2009,
he
began
actively
pursuing
a
career
as
a
producer,
collaborating
with
Charlotte
Gainsbourg
on
her
acclaimed
IRM
album;
two
years
later,
he
produced
Thurston
Moore's
Demolished
Thoughts
and
Mirror
Traffic
by
Stephen
Malkmus
&amp;
the
Jicks.
He
dipped
his
toe
back
into
solo
recording
on
the
soundtrack
to
the
2010
Edgar
Wright
film
Scott
Pilgrim
vs.
the
World,
but
between
2009
and
2010
much
of
his
studio
energy
was
devoted
to
his
Record
Club,
where
he
and
a
loose
collective
of
friends
covered
classic
albums
in
their
entirety;
the
albums
covered
included
The
Velvet
Underground
&amp;
Nico,
The
Songs
of
Leonard
Cohen,
and
INXS'
Kick.
Beck
returned
to
original
material
in
2012
via
Song
Reader,
a
collection
of
sheet
music
of
20
new,
unrecorded
songs;
Beck
did
not
record
versions
of
these
songs
but
did
appear
at
Song
Reader
concerts
featuring
other
musicians.
Early
in
2014,
Beck
released
Morning
Phase,
his
first
new
album
in
nearly
six
years
and
first
album
for
Capitol
Records.
Described
by
the
singer/songwriter
as
a
&quot;companion
piece&quot;
to
2002's
Sea
Change,
Morning
Phase
was
released
in
February
2014,
preceded
by
the
singles
&quot;Blue
Moon&quot;
and
&quot;Waking
Light.&quot;
