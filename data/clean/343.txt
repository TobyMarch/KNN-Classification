music
biography
although
he's
often
skirted
the
edges
of
blues
music
at
heart
saxophonist
keyboardist
and
composer
edgar
winter
is
a
blues
musician
raised
in
beaumont
tx
the
younger
brother
of
ukulele
player
and
guitarist
johnny
winter
edgar
winter
has
always
pushed
himself
in
new
directions
synthesizing
the
rock
blues
and
jazz
melodies
he
hears
in
his
head
as
a
consequence
his
fan
base
may
not
be
what
it
could
have
been
had
he
made
a
conscious
effort
—
like
his
brother
johnny
—
to
stay
in
a
bluesrock
mold
over
the
years
he's
one
musician
who's
never
been
afraid
to
venture
into
multiple
musical
arenas
often
times
within
the
space
of
one
album
as
in
his
debut
entrance
(1970
columbia
records)
edgar
winter
the
second
son
of
john
and
edwina
winter
was
born
december
28
1946
in
beaumont
tx
and
much
of
the
credit
for
edgar
and
johnny's
early
musical
awareness
must
go
to
the
brothers'
parents
who
have
been
a
constant
source
of
encouragement
throughout
their
respective
musical
careers
the
boys'
father
sang
in
a
barbershop
quartet
in
their
church
choir
and
played
saxophone
in
a
jazz
group
edgar
and
johnny
who's
three
years
older
began
performing
together
as
teens
playing
local
watering
holes
like
tom's
fish
camp
before
they
were
old
enough
to
drink
the
pair's
early
rb
and
blues
groups
included
johnny
and
the
jammers
the
crystaliers
and
the
black
plague
in
high
school
edgar
became
fascinated
with
the
saxophone
stylings
of
julian
cannonball
adderley
and
hank
crawford
and
he
began
playing
alto
sax
in
earnest
as
a
preteen
he
had
played
ukulele
like
his
older
brother
but
by
the
time
he
was
of
college
age
edgar
had
become
competent
on
keyboards
bass
guitar
and
drums
edgar
was
signed
to
epic
records
in
1970
after
performing
on
his
brother's
second
winter
album
he
recorded
entrance
his
debut
which
featured
himself
on
most
of
the
instruments
after
radio
success
accompanying
his
brother
on
johnny
winter
and
he
formed
a
large
horn
ensemble
called
white
trash
although
it
was
a
shortlived
group
which
broke
up
in
mid'72
winter
assembled
another
group
to
record
two
more
albums
for
epic
records
white
trash
and
roadwork
winter's
single
keep
playing
that
rock
'n'
roll
reached
number
70
on
the
us
rock
radio
charts
and
the
album
roadwork
hit
number
23
on
the
album
charts
by
the
summer
of
1972
through
constant
touring
(and
a
ready
willingness
to
do
interviews
unlike
his
older
brother)
winter
formed
the
edgar
winter
group
in
the
summer
of
1972
in
january
1973
epic
released
they
only
come
out
at
night
produced
by
guitarist
rick
derringer
which
reached
number
three
in
the
us
this
album
had
winter's
most
famous
song
frankenstein
which
reached
number
one
in
the
us
in
may
of
1973
later
that
year
free
ride
from
the
same
album
reached
number
14
although
he's
never
matched
that
kind
of
commercial
radio
success
again
winter
has
continued
to
tour
and
record
at
a
prolific
pace
he
relocated
from
new
york
city
to
beverly
hills
in
1989
to
pursue
movie
score
work
which
he's
had
some
success
with
most
notably
with
a
slightly
reworked
version
of
frankenstein
for
the
movie
wayne's
world
ii
although
his
early'70s
albums
like
entrance
white
trash
they
only
come
out
at
night
and
shock
treatment
are
bluesier
affairs
than
some
of
his
later
albums
there
are
blues
tunes
like
big
city
woman
on
one
of
his
1990s
releases
not
a
kid
anymore
(1994)
on
the
intersound
label
and
1999's
winter
blues
was
almost
wholly
devoted
to
the
idiom
a
good
introduction
to
winter
for
those
who
weren't
around
in
the
early
'70s
