strokes
longwave
the

and

one
of
several
groups
that
emerged
from
the
postpunk
revival
of

sound
is
generally
a
mix
of
staccato
bass
and
rhythmic
harmonized
guitar
with
a
snare
heavy
mix
drawing
comparisons
to
postpunk
bands
such
as
joy
division
and
the
chameleons[3]
aside
from
the
lyrics
their
songwriting
method
includes
all
of

than
relying
on
any
given
chief
songwriter[4]

commercial
and
critical
success

7
2010

history
[edit]
formation
(1997–2001)
[edit]
the
band
was
formed
by
kessler
and
drudy
kessler
had
been
looking
to
put
a
band
together
for
a
while
when
he
met
drudy
kessler
had
a
very
hard
time
finding
musicians
to
play
with—musicians
at
all
really[9]
kessler
met
dengler
in
a
philosophy
class
at
new
york
university
and
asked
him
if
he
played
an
instrument
later
kessler
ran
into
banks
(whom
he
had
first
met
in
france)
in
new
york
city's
east
village
and
the
pair
discussed
collaborating
banks
admitted
that
he
and
dengler
butted
heads
early
on
in
the
band's
history
but
told
spin
that
now
the
two
are
really
tight
in
a
spiritual
way[10]
the
band
had
trouble
choosing
a
name
at
first
i
got
to
the
point
where
i
was
like
'guys
we're
getting
decent
crowds
but
like
we
don't
have
a
name
so
no
one
knows
who
to
go
see
again'
kessler
said[9]
furthermore
the
band
considered
las
armas[9]
and
the
french
letters
as
names
before
adopting
interpol
in
2000
after
releasing
the
fukd
id
no&nbsp3
extendedplay
album
drudy
left
the
band
to
focus
on
hot
cross
and
his
label
level
plane
records
kessler
recruited
fogarino
who
worked
at
a
local
vintage
clothing
store
and
at
the
time
considered
retiring
from
music
to
replace
drudy[10]
while
a
member
of
interpol
drudy
was
also
a
member
of
seminal
firstwave
