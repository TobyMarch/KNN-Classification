for
the
two
or
three
minutes
consumed
by
a
song
jones
immerses
himself
so
completely
in
its
lyrics

in
the
mood
it
conveys
that
the
listener
can
scarcely
avoid
becoming
similarly
involved
waylon

a

alright
if

george
glenn
jones
was
born
on
september
12
1931
in
saratoga
texas
and
was
raised
in
vidor
texas
with
his
brother
and
five
sisters[4]
his
father
george
washington
jones
worked
in
a
shipyard
and
played
harmonica
and
guitar
while
his
mother
clara
played
piano
in
the
pentecostal
church
on
sundays[5]
during
his
delivery
one
of
the
doctors
dropped
jones
and
broke
his
arm[5]
when
he
was
seven
his
parents
bought
a
radio
and
he
heard
country
music
for
the
first
time
jones
recalled
to
billboard
in
2006
that
he
would
lie
in
bed
with
his
parents
on
saturday
nights
listening
to
the
grand
ole
opry
and
insist
that
his
mother
wake
him
if
he
fell
asleep
so
he
could
hear
roy
acuff
or
bill
monroe
in
his
autobiography
i
lived
to
tell
it
all
jones
explains
that
the
early
death
of
his
sister
ethel
spurred
on
his
father's
drinking
problem
and
by
all
accounts
george
washington
jones
could
be
physically
and
emotionally
abusive
to
his
wife
and
children
when
he
drank
in
the
book
george
jones
the
life
and
times
of
a
honky
tonk
legend
bob
allen
recounts
how
george
sr
would
return
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
his
cronies
roaring
drunk
wake
up
a
terrified
george
jr
and
demand
that
he
sing
for
them
or
face
a
beating
in
a
cmt
program
on
jones'
life
country
music
historian
robert
k
oermann
marveled
you
would
think
that
it
would
make
him
not
a
singer
because
it
was
so
abusively
thrust
on
him
but
the
opposite
happened
he
became
a
chronic
singer
he
became
someone
who
had
to
sing
in
the
same
program
jones
admitted
that
he
remained
ambivalent
and
resentful
towards
his
father
up
until
the
day
he
died
and
observed
in
his
autobiography
the
jones
family
makeup
doesn't
sit
well
with
liquordaddy
was
an
unusual
drinker
he
drank
to
excess
but
never
while
working
and
he
probably
was
the
hardest
working
man
i've
ever
known
his
father
bought
him
his
first
guitar
at
age
nine
and
he
learned
his
first
chords
and
songs
at
church
and
there
are
several
photographs
of
a
young
george
busking
on
the
streets
of
beaumont
he
left
home
at
16
and
went
to
jasper
texas
where
he
sang
and
played
on
the
ktxj
radio
station
with
fellow
musician
dalton
henderson
from
there
he
worked
at
the
kric
radio
station
during
one
such
afternoon
show
jones
met
his
idol
hank
williams
(i
just
stared
he
later
wrote)[5]
in
the
1989
video
documentary
same
ole
me
jones
admitted
i
couldn't
think
or
eat
nothin'
unless
it
was
hank
williams
and
i
couldn't
wait
for
his
next
record
to
come
out
he
had
to
be
really
the
greatest
he
married
his
first
wife
dorothy
bonvillion
in
1950
but
they
divorced
in
1951
he
was
enlisted
in
the
united

[edit]
jones
married
shirley
ann
corley
in
1954
his
first
record
the
selfpenned
no
money
in
this
deal
appeared
in
february
1954
on
starday
records
and
began
the
singer's
association
with
producer
and
mentor
hw
pappy
dailey
the
song
was
actually
cut
in
jack
starnes'
living
room
(starnes
formed
starday
records
with
daily)
jones
also
worked
at
krtm
in
beaumont
around
this
time
deejay
gordon
baxter
told
nick
tosches
that
jones
acquired
the
nickname
possum
while
working
there
one
of
the
deejays
there
slim
watts
took
to
calling
him
george
p
willicker
picklepuss
possum
jones
for
one
thing
he
cut
his
hair
short
like
a
possum's
belly
he
had
a
possum's
nose
and
stupid
eyes
like
a
possum
during
his
early
recording
sessions
daily
admonished
jones
for
attempting
to
sound
too
much
like
his
heroes
hank
williams
and
lefty
frizzell
jones'
first
hit
came
with
why
baby
why
in
1955
that
same
year
while
touring
as
a
cast
member
of
the
louisiana
hayride
jones
met
and
played
shows
with
elvis
presley
and
johnny
cash
i
didn't
get
to
know
him
that
well
jones
said
of
presley
to
nick
tosches
in
1994
he
stayed
pretty
much
with
his
friends
around
him
in
his
dressing
room
nobody
seemed
to
get
around
him
much
any
length
of
time
to
talk
to
him
jones
would
however
remain
a
lifelong
friend
of
johnny
cash
jones
was
invited
to
sing
at
the
grand
ole
opry
in
1956
with
presley's
explosion
in
popularity
in
1956
pressure
was
put
on
jones
to
cut
a
few
rockabilly
sides
and
he
reluctantly
agreed
his
heart
was
never
in
it
however
and
he
quickly
regretted
the
decision
in
his
autobiography
he
joked
during
the
years
when
i've
encountered
those
records
i've
used
them
for
frisbees
he
explained
to
billboard
in
2006
i
was
desperate
when
you're
hungry
a
poor
man
with
a
house
full
of
kids
you're
gonna
do
some
things
you
ordinarily
wouldn't
do
i
said
'well
hell
i'll
try
anything
once'
i
tried
dadgum
it
how
come
it
and
rock
it
a
bunch
of
shit
i
didn't
want
my
name
on
the
rock
and
roll
thing
so
i
told
them
to
put
thumper
jones
on
it
and
if
it
did
something
good
if
it
didn't
hell
i
didn't
want
to
be
shamed
with
it
jones
went
on
to
say
he
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
buy
all
the
masters
to
keep
the
cuts
from
surfacing
later
which
they
did[7]
jones
moved
to
mercury
in
1957
in
early
1957
jones
teamed
up
with
singer
jeannette
hicks
the
first
of
several
duet
partners
he
would
have
over
the
years
and
enjoyed
yet
another
top
ten
single
with
yearning
starday
records
merged
with
mercury
that
same
year
and
jones
scored
high
marks
on
the
charts
with
his
debut
mercury
release
of
don't
stop
the
music
meanwhile
george
was
travelling
the
blacktop
roads
in
a
1940s
packard
with
his
name
and
phone
number
emblazoned
on
the
side
although
he
was
garnering
a
lot
of
attention
and
his
singles
were
making
very
respectable
showings
on
the
charts
jones
was
still
playing
the
blood
bucket
circuit
of
honkytonks
that
dotted
the
rural
countryside[8]
commercial
breakout
(1959–64)
[edit]
in
1959
he
had
his
first
number
one
on
the
billboard
country
chart
with
white
lightnin'
ironically
a
more
authentic
rock
and
roll
sound
than
his
halfhearted
rockabilly
cuts
in
the
same
ole
me
retrospective
johnny
cash
insisted
george
jones
woulda
been
a
really
hot
rockabilly
artist
if
he'd
approached
it
from
that
angle
well
he
was
really
but
never
got
the
credit
for
it
white
lightnin'
was
written
by
jp
richardson
better
known
as
the
big
bopper
in
i
lived
to
tell
it
all
jones
confessed
that
he
showed
up
for
the
recording
session
under
the
influence
of
a
great
deal
of
alcohol
and
it
took
him
approximately
80
takes
just
to
record
his
vocals
to
make
matters
worse
buddy
killen
who
played
the
upright
bass
on
the
recording
was
reported
as
having
severely
blistered
fingers
from
having
to
play
his
bass
part
80
times
killen
not
only
threatened
to
quit
the
session
but
also
threatened
to
physically
harm
jones
for
the
painful
consequences
of
jones'
drinking
on
the
final
vocal
take
used
on
the
recording
jones
slurs
the
word
slug
something
he
would
mimic
in
live
performances
of
the
song
one
aspect
of
jones'
early
career
that
is
often
overlooked
is
his
success
as
a
songwriter
he
wrote
or
cowrote
many
of
his
biggest
hits
during
this
period
several
of
which
have
become
standards
like
the
window
up
above
(later
a
smash
for
mickey
gilley
in
1975)
and
seasons
of
my
heart
(a
hit
for
johnny
cash
and
also
recorded
by
willie
nelson
and
jerry
lee
lewis)
jones
wrote
just
one
more

recorded
by
cash)

(a
top

hit
for
stonewall
jackson
in
1959)

be

jones'
most
frequent
songwriting
collaborator
was
his
childhood
friend
darrell
edwards
jones
signed
with
united
artists
in
1962
and
immediately
scored
one
of
the
biggest
hits
of
his
career
she
thinks
i
still
care
his
voice
had
grown
noticeably
deeper
during
this
period
and
he
began
cultivating
the
singing
style
that
became
uniquely
his
own
during
his
stint
with
ua
jones
recorded
tribute
albums
to
hank
williams
and
bob
wills
and
cut
an
album
of
duets
with
melba
montgomery
including
the
hit
we
must
have
been
out
of
our
minds
jones
was
also
well
on
his
way
to
gaining
a
reputation
as
a
notorious
hellraiser
in
his
rolling
stone
tribute
merle
haggard
recalls
i
met
him
at
the
blackboard
caf&eacute
in
bakersfield
california
which
was
the
place
to
go
in
'61
he
was
already
famous
for
not
showing
up
or
showing
up
drunk
and
he
showed
up
drunk
i
was
onstage

i
think
i
was
singing
marty
robbins'
devil
woman

and
he
kicked
the
doors
of
the
office
open
and
said
'who
the
fuck
is
that?'
it
was
one
the
greatest
compliments
of
my
entire
life
when
george
jones
said
i
was
his
favorite
country
singerin
1967
i
released
a
ballad
called
i
threw
away
the
rose
and
he
was
so
impressed
he
actually
jumped
ship
and
left
his
tour
rented
a
lear
jet
and
came
to
amarillo
texas
he
told
me
my
low
note
changed
his
life
he
also
folded
my
steel
guitarist
fuzzy
owen
in
a
rollaway
bed
and
rolled
him
out
on
the
street
that
was
the
pinnacle
former
president
of

records
don
pierce
told
director
mark
hall
in
1989
another
famous
story
about
jones
after
pappy
daily
bailed
him
out
of
the
drunk
tank
and
got
him
a
gig
in
houston
for
$2500
the
next
day
jones
came
to
dailey's
office
broke
again
according
to
pierce
an
irritated
dailey
said
well
george
you
just
made
$2500
but
i
talked
to
some
of
the
guys
you
were
out
partying
with
and
they
said
you
went
and
flushed
it
down
the
toilet
pappy

lie!

a
good
year
for
the
roses
and
if
my
heart
had
windows
by
this
point
jones'
singing
style
had
evolved
from
the
fullthroated
high
lonesome
sound
of
hank
williams
and
roy
acuff
on
his
early
starday
records
to
the
more
refined
subtle
style
of
lefty
frizzell
in
a
2006
interview
with
billboard
jones
acknowledged
the
texan's
influence
on
his
idiosyncratic
phrasing
i
got
that
from
lefty
he
always
made
five
syllables
out
of
one
damn
word
jones'
binge
drinking
and
use
of
amphetamines
on
the
road
caught
up
to
him
in
1967
and
he
had
to
be
admitted
into
a
neurological
hospital
to
seek
treatment
for
his
drinking
jones
would
go
to
extreme
lengths
for
a
drink
if
the
thirst
was
on
him
perhaps
the
most
famous
drinking
story
concerning
jones
occurred
while
he
was
married
to
his
second
wife
shirley
corley
jones
recalled
shirley
making
it
physically
impossible
for
him
to
travel
to
beaumont
located
8
miles
away
to
buy
liquor
because
jones
would
not
walk
that
far
she
would
hide
the
keys
to
each
of
their
cars
they
owned
before
leaving
she
did
not
however
hide
the
keys
to
the
lawn
mower
upset
jones
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
over
his
property
he
later
described
his
thoughts
in
his
memoir
there
gleaming
in
the
glow
was
that
tenhorsepower
rotary
engine
under
a
seat
a
key
glistening
in
the
ignition
i
imagine
the
top
speed
for
that
old
mower
was
five
miles
per
hour
it
might
have
taken
an
hour
and
a
half
or
more
for
me
to
get
to
the
liquor
store
but
get
there
i
did[10][page&nbspneeded]
years
later
jones
comically
mocked
the
incident
by
making
a
cameo
in
the
video
for
all
my
rowdy
friends
are
coming
over
tonight
by
hank
williams
jr
he
also
parodied
the
episode
in
the
1993
video
for
one
more
last
chance
by
vince
gill
and
in
his
own
music
video
for
the
single
honky
tonk
song
in
1996
curiously
in
her
1979
autobiography
stand
by
your
man
tammy
wynette
claims
the
incident
occurred
while
she
was
married
to
jones
maintaining
that
she
woke
up
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
find
her
husband
gone
i
got
into
the
car
and
drove
to
the
nearest
bar
10
miles
away
when
i
pulled
into
the
parking
lot
there
sat
our
ridermower
right
by
the
entrance
he'd
driven
that
mower
right
down
a
main
highway
he
looked
up
and
saw
me
and
said
‘well
fellas
here
she
is
now
my
little
wife
i
told
you
she'd
come
after
me’[11][page&nbspneeded]
jones
became
aware
of
tammy
wynette
because
their
tours
were
booked
by
the
same
agency
and
their
paths
sometimes
crossed
after
wynette's
first
minor
hit
apartment
#9
in
1966
wynette
was
married
to
songwriter
don
chapel
who
was
also
the
opening
act
for
her
shows
at
the
time
the
three
became
friends
but
eventually
jones
took
more
than
a
passing
fancy
to
wynette
who
was
eleven
years
his
junior
and
grew
up
listening
to
all
of
his
records
according
to
his
autobiography
jones
went
to
their
house
for
supper
and
while
she
was
fixing
the
meal
wynette
and
chapel
got
into
a
heated
exchange
with
chapel
calling
his
wife
a
son
of
a
bitch
jones
wrote
i
felt
rage
fly
all
over
me
i
jumped
from
my
chair
put
my
hands
under
the
dinner
table
and
flipped
it
over
dishes
utensils
and
glasses
flew
in
all
directions
don's
and
tammy's
eyes
got
about
as
big
as
the
flying
dinner
plates
jones
professed
his
love
for
wynette
on
the
spot
and
the
couple
were
married
in
1969
they
began
touring
together
and
jones
bought
out
his
contract
with
musicor
so
he
could
record
with
tammy
and
her
producer
billy
sherrill
on
epic
records
(the
singer
had
split
with
longtime
producer
pappy
daily
on
acrimonious
terms)
jones
and
wynette
became
known
as
mr

mrs
country
music
in
the
early
1970s
scoring
several
big
hits
including
we're
gonna
hold
on

not)
the
jet
set
in
october
1970
shortly
after
the
birth
of
their
only
child
tamala
georgette
jones
was
straightjacketed
and
committed
to
a
padded
cell
at
the
watson
clinic
in
lakeland
florida
after
a
drunken
bender
he
was
kept
there
to
detoxify
for
ten
days
before
being
released
with
a
prescription
for
librium
jones
managed
longer
stretches
of
sobriety
with
wynette
than
he
had
enjoyed
in
years
but
as
the
decade
wore
on
his
drinking
and
erratic
behavior
worsened
leading
to
the
couple's
divorce
in
1976
jones
accepted
the
responsibility
for
the
failure
of
the
marriage
but
vehemently
denied
wynette's
allegations
in
her
autobiography
that
he
beat
her
and
fired
a
shotgun
at
her
remarkably
jones
and
wynette
continued
playing
shows
and
drawing
crowds
in
the
years
after
their
divorce
as
fans
began
to
see
their
songs
mirroring
their
stormy
relationship
in
1980
they
recorded
the
album
together
again
and
scored
a
hit
with
two
story
house
jones
also
spoke
publicly
about
his
hopes
for
a
reconciliation
and
would
jokingly
reference
tammy
in
some
of
his
songs

during
performances
of
his
1981
hit
if
drinkin'
don't
kill
me
(her
memory
will)
he
would
sing
tammy's
memory
will

but
the
recrimination
continued
unabated
after
years
of
sniping
jones
and
wynette
appeared
to
make
peace
in
the
1990s
recording
a
final
album
one
and
even
touring
together
again
before
wynette's
death
in
1998
in
1995
jones
told
country
weekly
like
the
old
saying
goes
it
takes
time
to
heal
things
and
they've
been
healed
quite
a
while
jones
pairing
with
billy
sherrill
at
epic
records
came
as
a
surprise
to
many
sherrill
and
business
partner
glenn
sutton
are
regarded
as
the
defining
influences
of
the
countrypolitan
sound
a
smooth
amalgamation
of
pop
and
country
music
that
was
popular
during
the
late
1960s
and
throughout
the
1970s
a
far
cry
from
what
was
george's
honky
tonk
roots
despite
a
shaky
start
the
success
that
sherrill
had
with
jones
proved
to
be
his
most
enduring
although
billboard
chart
statistics
show
that
sherrill
had
his
biggest
commercial
successes
with
artists
such
as
wynette
and
charlie
rich
with
jones
sherrill
had
his
most
longestlasting
association
in
1974
they
scored
a
number
one
hit
with
the
door
(i've
heard
the
sound
of
my
dear
old
mother
cryin'/and
the
sound
of
the
train
that
took
me
off
to
war)
and
followed
that
in
1975
with
the
grand
tour
unlike
most
singers
who
might
have
been
overwhelmed
by
the
string
arrangements
and
background
vocalists
sherrill
sometimes
employed
on
his
records
jones'
voice
with
its
at
times
frightening
intensity
and
lucid
tone
could
stand
up
to
anything
while
jones
wrote
fewer
songs
himself

songwriters
had
been
tripping
over
themselves
pitching
songs
to
him
for
years

he
still
managed
to
cowrite
several
such
as
what
my
woman
can't
do
(covered
by
jerry
lee
lewis)
a
drunk
can't
be
a
man
the
harrowing
i
just
don't
give
a
damn
(perhaps
the
greatest
lost
classic
in
the
entire
jones
catalogue)
and
these
days
(i
barely
get
by)
which
he
had
written
with
wynette
in
the
late
seventies
jones
spiraled
out
of
control
already
drinking
constantly
a
manager
named
shug
baggot
introduced
him
to
cocaine
before
a
show
because
he
was
too
tired
to
perform
the
drug
would
increase
jones'
already
considerable
paranoia
during
one
drunken
binge
he
shot
at
and
very
nearly
hit
his
friend
and
occasional
songwriting
partner
earl
peanutt
montgomery
after
montgomery
had
quit
drinking
after
finding
religion
he
was
often
penniless
and
acknowledged
in
his
autobiography
that
waylon
jennings
and
johnny
cash
came
to
his
financial
aid
during
this
time
jones
also
began
missing
shows
at
an
alarming
rate
and
lawsuits
from
promoters
started
piling
up
in
1978
owing
wynette
$36000
in
child
support
and
claiming
to
be
one
million
dollars
in
debt
he
filed
for
bankruptcy
jones
appeared
incoherent
at
times
speaking
in
quarrelling
voices
that
he
would
later
call
the
duck
and
the
old
man
in
his
article
the
devil
in
george
jones
nick
tosches
states
by
february
1979
he
was
homeless
deranged
and
destitute
living
in
his
car
and
barely
able
to
digest
the
junk
food
on
which
he
subsisted
he
weighed
under
a
hundred
pounds
and
his
condition
was
so
bad
that
it
took
him
more
than
two
years
to
complete
my
very
special
guests
an
album
on
which
willie
nelson
linda
ronstadt
elvis
costello
and
other
famous
fans
came
to
his
vocal
aid
and
support
jones
entered
hillcrest
psychiatric
hospital
in
birmingham
alabama
upon
his
release
in
january
1980
the
first
thing
he
did
was
pick
up
a
sixpack
jones
often
displayed
a
sheepish
selfdeprecating
sense
of
humor
regarding
his
dire
financial
standing
and
bad
reputation
in
june
1979
he
appeared
with
waylon
jennings
on
ralph
emery's
syndicated
radio
program
and
at
one
point
jennings
cracked
it's
lonely
at
the
top
a
laughing
jones
replied
it's
lonely
at
the
bottom
too!
it's
real
real
lonely
waylon
despite
his
chronic
unreliability
jones
was
still
capable
of
putting
on
a
captivating
live
show
on
independence

1976
he
appeared
at
willie
nelson's
fourth
of
july
picnic
in
gonzales
texas
in

of

younger
country
rock
oriented

a
nervous
jones
felt
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
nearly
bolted
from
the
festival
but
went
on
anyway
and
wound
up
stealing
the

jones
began
missing
more
shows
than
he
made
however
including
several
highly
publicized
dates
at
the
bottom

club
in

former

and
so
forth
george
excused
himself
from
my
office
left

and
we
didn't
see
him
for
three
weeks
he
just
did
not
show
up
much
like
hank
williams
jones
seemed
suspicious
of
success
and
furiously
despised
perceived
slights
and
condescension
directed
towards
the
music
that
he
loved
so
dearly
when
he
finally
played
the
bottom
line
in
1980
the
new

times
called
him
the
finest
most
riveting
singer
in
country
music
comeback
(1980–1990)
[edit]
by
1980
jones
had
not
had
a
number
one
single
in
six
years
and
many
critics
began
to
write
him
off
however
the
singer
stunned
the
music
industry
in
april
when
he
stopped
loving
her
today
was
released
and
shot
to
number
one
on
the
country
charts
remaining
there
for
18
weeks
the
song
was
written
by
bobby
braddock
and
curly
putnam
and
tells
the
story
of
a
friend
who
has
never
given
up
on
his
love
he
keeps
old
letters
and
photos
from
back
in
the
day
and
hangs
on
to
hope
that
she
would
come
back
again
the
song
reaches
its
peak
in
the
chorus
revealing
that
he
indeed
stopped
loving
her
when
he
died
the
woman
does
return—for
his
funeral
in
a
lesser
singer's
hands
the
song
might
have
sounded
corny
or
even
comical
but
jones'
interpretation
buoyed
by
his
brilliant
delivery
of
the
line
first
time
i'd
seen
him
smile
in
years
gives
it
a
mournful
gripping
realism
when
it
began
being
played
on
the
radio
in
the
spring
of
1980
just
about
everyone
who
heard
it
was
floored
it
is
consistently
voted
as
the
greatest
country
song
of
all
time
along
with
i'm
so
lonesome
i
could
cry
by
hank
williams
and
crazy
by
patsy
cline[citation
needed]
according
to
producer
billy
sherrill
and
jones
himself
the
singer
hated
the
song
when
he
first
heard
it
in
bob
allen's
biography
of
the
singer
sherrill
states
he
thought
it
was
too
long
too
sad
too
depressing
and
that
nobody
would
ever
play
ithe
hated
the
melody
and
wouldn't
learn
it
sherrill
also
claims
that
jones
frustrated
him
by
continually
singing
the
song
to
the
melody
of
the
kris
kristofferson
hit
help
me
make
it
through
the
night
in
the
same
ole
me
retrospective
sherrill
recalls
a
heated
exchange
during
one
recording
session
i
said
'that's
not
the
melody!'
and
he
said
'yeah
but
it's
a
better
melody'
i
said
'it
might
be—kristofferson
would
think
so
too
it's
his
melody!'
in
the
same
documentary
sherrill
claims
that
jones
was
in
such
bad
physical
shape
during
this
period
that
the
recitation
was
recorded
18
months
after
the
first
verse
was
and
added
that
the
last
words
jones
said
about
he
stopped
loving
her
today
was
nobody'll
buy
that
morbid
son
of
a
bitch
a
big
part
of
jones'
success
over
the
years
was
that
he
could
always
smell
a
hit
but
this
time
his
instincts
were
woefully
off
although
he
had
disliked
he
stopped
loving
her
today
when
it
was
first
offered
to
him
jones
ultimately
gave
the
song
credit
for
reviving
his
flagging
career
stating
that
a
fourdecade
career
had
been
salvaged
by
a
threeminute
song
jones
earned
the
grammy
award
for
best
male
country
vocal
performance
in
1980
the
academy
of
country
music
awarded
the
song
single
of
the
year
and
song
of
the
year
in
1980
it
also
became
the
country
music
association's
song
of
the
year
in
both
1980
and
1981
the
success
of
he
stopped
loving
her
today
led
cbs
records
to
renew
jones'
recording
contract
and
sparked
new
interest
in
the
singer
he
was
the
subject
of
an
hourandaquarter
long
hbo
television
special
entitled
george
jones
with
a

from

performing
songs
with
waylon
jennings
elvis
costello
tanya

among
others
jones
continued
drinking
and
using
cocaine
appearing
at
various
awards
shows
to
accept
honors
for
he
stopped
loving
her
today
obviously
inebriated
his
condition
was
readily
apparent
when
he
slurred
the
words
to
i
was

when
country
wasn't
cool
with
barbara
mandrell
on
a

he
was
involved
in

chases
with
police
which
were
reported
on
the
national
news
and
one
arrest
was
filmed
by
a
local
tv
crew
the
video
which
is
widely
available
online
offers
a
glimpse
into
jones'
jekyll

persona
when
drinking
with
the
singer
looking
genuinely
frightening
as
he
argues
with
the

officer
and

remarked
that
when
he
first
interviewed
the
singer
in
april
1976
one
could
readily
believe
the
accounts
by
those
who
had
known
him
for
years
that
he
had
not
changed
much
at
all
and
that
he
had
been
impervious
to
fame
and
fortune
in
an
unusually
unguarded
selfappraisal
in
1981
the
singer
told
mark
rose
of
the
village
voice
i
don't
show
a
lot
of
affection
i
have
probably
been
a
very
unliked
person
among
family
like
somebody
who
was
heartless
i
saved
it
all
for
the
songs
i
didn't
know
you
were
suppose
to
show
that
love
person
to
person
i
guess
i
always
wanted
to
but
i
didn't
know
how
the
only
way
i
could
would
be
to
do
it
in
a
song
years
later
he
commented
to
the
christian
broadcasting
network's
scott
ross
i
think
you're
mad
at
yourself
i
think
that
you're
sayin'
to
yourself
'you
don't
deserve
this
you
don't
deserve
those
fans
you
don't
deserve
makin'
this
money'
and
you're
mad
at
yourself
and
you
beat
up
on
yourself
by
drinkin'
and
losing
friends
that
won't
put
up
with
thatit's
just
one
terrible
big
mess
you
make
out
of
your
life
in
1982
jones
recorded
the
album
a
taste
of
yesterday's
wine
with
merle
haggard
while
the
album
cover
was
shocking
with
jones
looking
gaunt
and
wasted
his
singing
was
flawless
his
run
of
hits
also
continued
in
the
early
1980s
with
the
singer
charting
i'm
not
ready
yet
same

(backed
by
the

doin'

we
didn't
see
a
thing
(a
duet
with
ray
charles)
and
i
always
get
lucky
with
you
which
was
jones'
last
number
one
in
1984
in
1981
jones
met
nancy
sepulvado
a
34yearold
divorc&eacutee
from
mansfield
louisiana
sepulvado's
positive
impact
on
jones'
life
and
career
cannot
be
overestimated
she
eventually
cleaned
up
his
finances
kept
him
away
from
his
drug
dealers
(who
reportedly
kidnapped
her
daughter
in
retaliation)
and
managed
his
career
jones
always
gave
her
complete
credit
for
saving
his
life
nancy
who
did
not
drink
explained
to
nick
tosches
in
1994
he
was
drinking
but
he
was
fun
to
be
around
it
wasn't
love
at
first
sight
or
anything
like
that
but
i
saw
what
a
good
person
he
was
deep
down
and
i
couldn't
help
caring
about
him
jones
managed
to
quit
cocaine
but
went
on
a
drunken
rampage
in
alabama
in
the
fall
of
1983
and
was
once
again
straightjacketed
and
committed
to
hillcrest
psychiatric
hospital
suffering
from
malnutrition
and
delusions
but
by
this
time
physically
and
emotionally
exhausted
he
really
did
want
to
quit
drinking
in
march
1984
in
birmingham
alabama

at
the
age
of
52

jones
performed
his
first
stone
cold
sober
show
since
the
early
seventies
all
my
life
it
seems
like
i've
been
running
from
something
he
told
the
united
press
international
in
june
if
i
knew
what
it
was
maybe
i
could
run
in
the
right
direction
but
i
always
seem
to
end
up
going
the
other
way
jones
began
making
up
many
of
the
dates
he
had
missed
playing
them
for
free
to
pay
back
promoters
and
began
opening
his
concerts
with
no
show
jones
a
song
he
had
written
with
glen
martin
that
poked
fun
at
himself
and
other
country
singers
jones
always
stressed
that
he
was
not
proud
of
the
way
he
treated
loved
ones
and
friends
over
the
years
and
was
ashamed
of
disappointing
his
fans
when
he
missed
shows
telling
billboard
in
2006
now
i
know
it
hurt
my
fans
in
a
way
and
i've
always
been
sad
about
that
it
really
bothered
me
for
a
long
time
mostly
sober
for
the
rest
of
the
1980s
jones
consistently
released
albums
with
sherrill
producing
including

(1990–2013)
[edit]
in
1990
jones
released
his
last
proper
studio
album
on
epic
you
oughta
be
here
with
me
although
the
album
featured
several
stirring
performances
including
the
lead
single
hell
stays
open
all
night
long
and
the
roger
millerpenned
title
song
the
single
bombed
and
jones
made
the
switch
to
mca
ending
his
relationship
with
sherrill
and
what
was
now
sony
music
after
19
years
his
first
album
with
mca
and
along
came
jones
was
released
in
1991
and
backed
by
mca's
powerful
promotion
team
and
producer
kyle
lehning
(who
had
produced
a
string
of
hit
albums
for
randy
travis)
the
album
sold
better
than
his
previous
one
had
however
two
singles
you
couldn't
get
the
picture
and
she
loved
a
lot
in
her
time
(a
tribute
to
jones'
mother
clara)
did
not
crack
the
top
30
on
the
charts
as
jones
lost
favor
with
country
radio
as
the
format
was
altered
radically
during
the
early
1990s
his
last
album
to
have
significant
radio
airplay
was
1992's
walls
can
fall
which
featured
the
novelty
song
finally
friday
and
i
don't
need
your
rockin'
chair
a
testament
to
his
continued
vivaciousness
in
old
age
despite
the
loss
of
radio
airplay
jones
continued
to
record
and
tour
throughout
the
1990s
and
was
inducted
into
the
country
music
hall
of
fame
by
randy
travis
in
1992
in
1996
jones
released
his
autobiography
i
lived
to
tell
it
all
with
tom
carter
and
the
irony
of
his
long
career
was
not
lost
on
him
with
the
singer
writing
in
its
preface
i
also
know
that
a
lot
of
my
showbusiness
peers
are
going
to
be
angry
after
reading
this
book
so
many
have
worked
so
hard
to
maintain
their
careers
i
never
took
my
career
seriously
and
yet
it's
flourishing
he
also
pulled
no
punches
about
his
disappointment
in
the
direction
country
music
had
taken
devoting
a
full
chapter
to
the
changes
in
the
country
music
scene
of
the
1990s
that
saw
him
removed
from
radio
playlists
in
favor
of
a
younger
generation
of
popinfluenced
country
stars
despite
his
absence
from
the
country
charts
during
this
time
latterday
country
superstars
such
as
garth
brooks
randy
travis
alan
jackson
and
many
others
often
paid
tribute
to
jones
while
expressing
their
love
and
respect
for
his
legacy
as
a
true
country
legend
who
paved
the
way
for
their
own
success
on
february
17
1998
the
nashville
network
premiered
a
group
of
television
specials
called
the

show
with
jones
as
host[5]
the
program
featured
informal
chats
with

among

while
jones
remained
committed
to
pure
country
he
worked
with
the
top
producers
and
musicians
of
the
day
and
the
quality
of
his

times
a
day
when
the
last
curtain
falls
and
the
novelty
hightech
redneck
jones
most
popular
song
in
his
later
years
was
choices
the
first
single
from
his
1999
studio
album
cold
hard
truth
a
video
was
also
made
for
the
song
and
jones
won
another
grammy
for
best
male
country
vocal
performance
the
song
was
at
the
center
of
controversy
when
the
country
music
association
invited
jones
to
perform
it
on
the
awards
show
but
required
that
he
perform
an
abridged
version
jones
refused
and
did
not
attend
the
show
alan
jackson
was
disappointed
with
the
association's
decision
and
halfway
through
his
own
performance
during
the
show
he
signaled
to
his
band
and
played
part
of
jones'
song
in
protest
on
march
6

jones
was
involved

jones
pleaded
guilty
to
drunk
driving
charges
related
to
the
accident[13]
the
crash
was
a
significant
turning
point
as
he
explained
to
billboard
in
2006

i
had
that
wreck

made
up

legacy
[edit]
part
of
the
reason
jones
was
such
an
emotive
interpreter
of
country
music
may
have
been
because
he
simply
loved
the
music
more
than
anyone
else
he
tirelessly
defended
its
integrity
it's
never
been
for
the
love
of
money
he
told
billboard
in
2006
i
thank
god
for
it
because
it
makes
me
a
living
but
i
sing
because
i
love
it
not
because
of
the
dollar
signs
jones
also
went
out
of
his
way
to
promote
younger
country
singers
that
he
felt
were
as
passionate
about
the
music
as
he
was
everybody
knows
he's
a
great
singer
alan
jackson
stated
in
1995
but
what
i
like
most
about
george
is
that
when
you
meet
him
he
is
like
some
ole
guy
that
works
down
at
the
gas
stationeven
though
he's
a
legend!
jones
influence
as
a
singer
is
beyond
question
shortly
after
his
death
andrew
mueller
wrote
in
uncut
he
was
one
of
the
finest
interpretive
singers
who
ever
lifted
a
microphonethere
cannot
be
a
single
country
songwriter
of
the
last
50odd
years
who
has
not
wondered
what
it
might
be
like
to
hear
their
words
sung
by
that
voice
in
1994
country
music
historian
colin
escott
pronounced
contemporary
country
music
is
virtually
founded
on
reverence
for
george

of

singers

always
tops
it

george
jones
the
spirit
of
country
richard
kienzle
confirms
jones
sings
of
people
and
stories
that
are
achingly
human
he
can
turn
a
ballad
into
a
catharsis
by
wringing
every
possible
emotion
from
it
making
it
a
primal
strangled
cry
of
anguish
in
a
quote
that
appeared
on
the
sleeve
of
jones'
1976
album

emmylou

when
you

you
are
hearing

who
takes

makes
it
a
work

art

always
in

ole

several

stars
offer
similar
thoughts

ask
me

is

say
'you

besides
george
jones?'
randy

it
sounds
like
he's
lived
every

of
every
word
that
he
sings
and
there's
very
few
people
who
can
do
that
tom

it
was
always
jones
who
got
the
message
across
just
right
and
roy
acuff
i'd
give
anything
if
i
could
sing
like
george
jones
in
the
same
documentary
producer
billy
sherrill
states
all
i
did
was
change
the
instrumentation
around
him
i
don't
think
he's
changed
at
all
jones
dedication
to
what
he
called
hardcore
country
music
remained
resolute
until
the
day
he
died
influence
beyond
country
music
[edit]
unlike
some
of
his
contemporaries
jones
stuck
with
country
music
with
a
vengeance
ironically
without
even
trying
jones'
unabashed
loyalty
to
strictly
country
arrangements
attracted
the
admiration
of
musicians
and
songwriters
from
a
wide
range
of
genres
in
an
oftenquoted
tribute
frank
sinatra
called
jones
the
second
best
singer
in
america
in
a
rolling
stone
interview
in
1969
bob
dylan
was
asked
what
he
thought
was
the
best
song
released
in
the
previous
year
and
he
replied
george
jones
had
one
called
'small
town
laboring
man'
in
his
autobiography
chronicles
dylan
states
that
in
the
early
1960s
he
was
largely
unimpressed
by
what
he
heard
on
the
radio
and
admits
outside
of
maybe
george
jones
i
didn't
listen
to
country
music
either
country
rock
pioneer
gram

parsons
reignited
keith
richards'
interest
in
country
music
in
the
early
seventies
and
after
jones'
death
in
2013
the
guitarist
wrote
he
possessed
the
most
touching
voice
the
most
expressive
ways
of
projecting
that
beautiful
instrument
of
anyone
i
can
call
to
mind
you
heard
his
heart
in
every
note
he
sang
richards
recorded
say
it's
not
you
with
jones
for
the
bradley
barn
sessions
in
1994
and
recalls
in
his
autobiography
hearing
him
sing
for
the
first
time
when
the
rolling
stones
and
jones
were
on
the
same
show
in
texas
in
1964
they
trailed
in
with
tumbleweed
following
them
as
if
tumbleweed
was
their
pet
dust
all
over
the
place
a
bunch
of
cowboys
but
when
george
got
up
we
went
whoa
there's
a
master
up
there
in
an
interview
for
the
1989
rolling
stones
documentary
25x5
mick
jagger
also
cites
jones
as
one
of
his
favorite
country
singers
john
prine
mentions
jones
in
his
song
jesus
the
missing
years
jones
fan
elvis
costello
had
a
surprise
hit
in
the
uk
when
he
covered
a
good
year
for
the
roses
in
1981
elliott
smith
told
an
interviewer
about
his
idea
of
heaven
george
jones
would
be
singing
all
the
time
it
would
be
like
new
york
in
reverse
people
would
be
nice
to
each
other
for
no
reason
at
all
and
it
would
smell
good
in
a
2001
interview
with
mark
binelli
from
rolling
stone
leonard
cohen
asked
have
you
heard
george
jones'
last
record
cold
hard
truth?
i
love
to
hear
an
old
guy
lay
out
his
situation
he
has
the
best
voice
in
america
the
day
jones
died
cohen
performed
choices
on
stage
in
winnipeg
canada
as
a
tribute
to
the
country
legend
in
2013
robbie
robertson
told
uncut
he
was
the
ray
charles
of
country
music

the
one
who
could
make
you
cry
with
his
voicewe
wouldn't
listen
to
country
music
the
guys
in
the
band
but
we'd
listen
to
george
jones
james
taylor
who
wrote
bartenders
blues
with
jones
in
mind
and
sang
background
vocals
with
him
on
the
recording
told
rolling
stone
he
sounds
like
a
steel
guitar
it's
the
way
he
blends
notes
the
way
he
comes
up
to
them
the
way
he
crescendos
and
decrescendos
the
dynamic
of
it
is
very
tight
and
very
controlled

it's
like
carving
with
the
voice
other
disparate
artists
who
recorded
with
jones
include
dennis
locorriere
and
ray
sawyer
of
dr
hook
mark

the

singers
leon
russell
bb

and
