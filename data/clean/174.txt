the
earliest
song
in
praise
of
queen
elizabeth
i
is
not
a
madrigal
lute
song
consort
song
or
anthem
–
the
genres
most
widely
associated
with
her
reign
–
but
a
modest
broadside
ballad
by
one
william
birche
his
a
songe&nbspbetweene&nbspthe
quenes&nbspmaiestie
and
england
(now
in
the
library
of
the
society
of
antiquaries)
is
a
charming
love
song
between
bessy
(elizabeth)
and
her
realm
the
surviving
copy
was
published
in
1564
but
it
this
was
probably
a
reprinting
on
an
earlier
version
published
in
15589
shortly
after
her
coronation
as
a
broadside
ballad
it
would
have
circulated
widely
printed
on
a
single
sheet
it
would
have
been&nbspsold
cheaply
and
could
also
have
been
learnt
orally
through
hearing
the
ballad
seller
singing
his
wares
or
his
customers
enjoying
their
purchases
ballads
were
found
pasted
up
in
alehouses
and
private
homes
and
were
enjoyed
by
nobility
and
poor
husbandmen
alike

song
melody
‘come
over
the

to
one
of
two
similar
tunes
either
‘ouer

or

musical
setting
of
a
songe&nbspbetweene&nbspthe
queenes&nbspmaiestie
and
england
as
early
as
her
coronation
day
elizabeth’s
reputation
as
a
monarch
who
loved
and
was
loved
by
her
people
was
being
forged
richard
mulcaster
described
london
during
her
precoronation
procession
as
‘a
stage
wherein
was
showed
the
wonderful
spectacle
of
a
noble
hearted
princess
toward
her
most
loving
people’
(the
passage
of
our
most
drad&nbspsoueraigne
1559)
birche’s
song
too
emphasises
the
intimate
bond
between
queen
and
kingdom
in
the
first
verse
tells
how
elizabeth
was
supposedly
called
by
england
to
be
queen
and
then
england
asks
bessy
to
give
her
hand
in
marriage
england
i
am
thy
lover
fair
hath
chose
thee
to
mine
heir
and
my
name
is
merry
england
therefore
come
away
and
make
no
more
delay
sweet
bessy
give
me
thy
hand
bessy
here
is
my
hand
my
dear
lover
england
i
am
thine
both
with
mind
and
heart
for
ever
to
endure
thou
mayest
be
sure
until
death
us
two
depart
with
the
character
of
merry
england
birche&nbsplooks
ahead
to
a
new
golden
age
of
english
prosperity
yet
the
ballad
presents
a
complex
and
paradoxical
set
of
relationships
between
bessy
and
england
she
is
england’s
‘dear
lady’
lover
wife
and
heir
elizabeth’s&nbsprole
as
lover
and
‘dear
lady’
suggests
the
same&nbsptrue
affection
between
kingdom
and
monarch
evoked
by
mulcaster
this
is
followed
by
the
bond
of
marriage
suggesting
the
official
coronation
ceremony
that
has
bound
monarch
and
country
and
in
which
the
monarch
also
received
a
ring
this
metaphor
of
a
monarch
marrying&nbsptheir
kingdom
dated
back
to
at
least
1300
and
had
been
employed
by
elizabeth
herself
in
her
speech
to
parliament
in
1559
[3]
finally
her
representation
as
heir
underlines
her
legitimate
claim
to
the
throne
the
emphasis
on
her
englishness
both
distanced
her
from
her
sister
mary
i
who
was
popularly
perceived
as
spanish
(because
of
her
spanish
mother
and
marriage
to
philip
ii)
and
also
used
her
subjects’
sense
of
national
identity
to
encourage
a
bond
of
loyalty
with
their
new
queen
the
ballad
also
recognises
that
elizabeth
has
not
always
been
treated
with
such
affection
and
it
stages
a
scene
of
forgiveness
and
reconciliation
bessy
describes
her
imprisonment
during
in
the
tower
and
at
woodstock
during
mary’s
reign
england
makes
its
excuses
for
her
treatment
(tyrants
and
fear)
painting
a
picture
of
a
country
that
had
lamented
the
reign
of
mary
and
waited
eagerly
for
elizabeth’s
accession
expressing
disbelief
at
her
treatment
england
confirms
her
legitimacy
surely
these
enemies
were
mad
men
who
did
not
know
she
was
daughter
of
henry
princess
by
birth
and
sister
to
mary?
bessy
responds
by
graciously
offering
her
forgiveness
to
all
those
who
amend
their
ways
her
quasireligious&nbsppersona
becomes
increasingly
explicit
until
the
final
verses
hail
her
as
‘sweet
virgin
pure’
and
‘handmaid
of
the
lord’
elizabeth/bessy
becomes
a
second
virgin
mary
the
image&nbsppresents
her
piety
purity
and
divine
appointment
as
the
crowning
arguments
for
her
authority
the
charmingly
informal
image
of
two
lovers
has
formalised
into
one
of
queen
and&nbspkingdom
with
the
monarch
bidding
the
realm
to
be
obedient
and
the
subjects
praying
for
her
long
reign
they
end
united
in
praise
and
prayer
to
god
all
honour
laud
and
praise
be
to
the
lord
god
always
who
has
all
princes’
hearts
in
his
hands
that
by
his
power
and
might
he
may
give
them
a
right
for
the
wealth
of
all
christian
lands
what
does
this
song
represent?
was
this
official
propaganda
instructed
by
elizabeth
or
a
member
of
her
government
in
a
format
that
could
carry
across
the
country
as
both
printed
broadside
and
orallycirculated&nbspsong?
or
was
birche’s&nbspsong
an
enthusiastic
outpouring
from
an
enthusiastic
protestant
thrilled
to
be
rid
of
the
catholic
mary
and
hoping
to
gain
some
early
favour
with
the
new
queen?
birche’s
protestantism
is
evident
from
his
other
godly
ballads&nbspa
warnyng
to
england
let
london
beginto
repent
their
iniquitie

flie
from
their
sin&nbsp(1565?)&nbspending
with
a
prayer&nbspfor
elizabeth
the
complaint
of
a
sinner
vexed
with
paine
(1563?)
and
a
free
admonition
without
any
fees/to
warne&nbspthe
papistes
to
beware
of
three
trees
(1571)&nbspwhich
ends
with
a
resolute
‘god
save
our
queene&nbspelizabeth’&nbspor
are
we&nbspperhaps&nbspin
danger
of
being
taken
in
by
the
very
rhetoric
of
mutual
love
birche’s&nbspsong
pours
forth?
one
can
hardly
imagine
birche
being
allowed
to
print
(and
reprint)
a
song
that
goes
as
far
as
putting
words
in
the
queen’s
mouth
if
it
did
not
at
least
have
royal
approval
yet
if
it
was
officially
instigated
by
elizabeth’s
government
it
was
not
a
strategy
that
elizabeth
was
quick
to
repeat
not
until
15778
were
official
broadside
songs
of
praise
produced
this
time
by&nbsproyal
printer
christopher
barker
to
commemorate&nbspher
accession
day
on
17
november
these
however
were
sung
prayers
and
thanksgivings
of
a
more
sober
nature
than
birche’s
charming
dialogue
whether
officially
instigated
or
merely
royally
approved&nbspbirche’s
ballad
certainly
started
the
process
of
constructing
and
disseminating
across
the
kingdom
aspects
of
the
royal
image
that
were
to
become
characteristic
of
her
reign
elizabeth’s
status
as
one
divinely
appointed
by
god
and
under
his
direct
protection
and&nbspthe
ideal
of
a
mutual&nbspaffection
between
the
queen
and

musicologists
and
literary
historians
came
together
to
discuss
changing
concepts
of
creativity
and
the
self
in
the
turbulent
political
economic
social
and
intellectual
times
of
the
seventeenth
century
last
tuesday
14
may
around
35
musicologists
and
literary
scholars
met
at
senate
house
in
london
to
explore
seventeenthcentury
notions
of
creativity
and
the
self
in
an
event
supported
by
the
humanities
and
arts
research
centre
at
royal
holloway
(see
previous
post)
convenor
stephen
rose
opened
the
study
day
with
an
overview
of&nbsphow
this
period&nbspis&nbspregarded
as
both
a
time&nbspof&nbspcrisis
and&nbspthe
origin
of&nbspmany
concepts
considered
central
to
modernity&nbspsignificant
changes
in
climate
known
as
the
‘little
ice
age’
led
to
successive
harvest
failure
famine
disease
and
death
political
unrest
spread
through
europe
–
exemplified
in
the
english
civil
war
–
and
was
symptomatic
of
a
wider
crisis
of
authority
that
encompassed
not
only
governance
of
the
state
but
the
continued
challenging
of
religious
authority
as
the
centrality
of
court
and
an
allencompassing
church
dissolved
new
ways
of
affirming
the
place
of
the
individual
in
the
wider
world
had
to
be
found
and
many
regard
this
as
the
time
when
a
new
individualised
subjectivity
emerged
in
addition
intellectual
challenges
saw
the
primacy
of
classical
antiquity
and
acceptance
of
ancient
wisdom
undermined
instead
new
philosophical
methods
relying
on
experiment
and
observation
promised
fresh
insights
into
the
natural
world
with
these
new
approaches
to
knowledge
came
debates
about
the
relative
natures
of
truth
and
falsehood
subjectivity
and
objectivity
invention
and
truth
across
the
philosophical
and
literary
spheres
many
of
these
issues
emerged
as
threads
between
the
day’s
various
papers
matthew
laube
began
with
a
paper
illustrating
the
role
of
music
performance
in
fashioning
confessional
identities
in
heidelburg
c1600
religious
identity&nbsprecurred
as
a&nbsptheme&nbspwhen
alan
howard
described
the
unlikely
friendship
between
the
catholic
royalist
composer
matthew
locke
and
the
parliamentarian
soldier
and
amateur
musician
silas
locke
a
friendship&nbspthat
was
fostered
in
music
meetings
and
the
exchange
of
pieces
later
michael
lee’s
paper
touched
on
issues
of
national
identity
as
he
explored
dennis
and
eccles’
processes
of
adaptation
in
rinaldo
and
armida
(1698)
as
they
sought
to
transform
the
earlier
models
of
tasso
quinault
and
lully
into
a
means
of
projecting
a
new
english
heroic
identity
and
to
improve
the
role
of
music
in
contemporary
dramatick
opera
katie
bank’s
paper
on
english
madrigals
and
consort
songs
raised
the
issue
of
veracity
uniting
the
emerging
empiricism
with
concerns
over
notions
of
truth
in
travelwriting
and
poetry
she
presented
music
as
simultaneously
able
to
evoke
wonder
and
portray
convincing
representations
of
the
self
similarly
my
own
paper
explored
how
members
of
the
royal
society
interpreted
the
veracity
of
classical
mythology
and
the
claims
of
ancient
music’s
exceptionality
attempts
by
some
fellows
to
defend
modern
music
led
them
to
challenge
the
centrality
of
the
passions
and
musical
rhetoric
that
had
underpinned
musical
thought
throughout
the
seventeenth
century
the
two
themes
of
identity
and
truth
merged
in
elaine
mcgirr’s
discussion
of
celebrity
actors
nell
gwynn
thomas
betterton
and
colley
cibber
for
each
of
these
actors
fame
depended
on
a
slippage
between
their
onstage
and
offstage
roles
reallife
events
and
fictitious
anecdotes
creating
the
illusion
of
knowing
the
actor’s
‘true’
person
that
is
characteristic
of
modern
celebrity
the
richness
of
john
butt’s
keynote
lecture
can
hardly
be
captured
in
this
short
summary
but
here
are
a
few
of
his
ideas
which
particularly
struck
me
taking
the
notion
of
individualised
subjectivity
as
a
defining
characteristic
of
modernity
he
showed
how
the
arias
of
the
st
matthew
passion
serve
to
evoke
the
individual
subjectivities
of
these
reflectors
on
the
unfolding
biblical
events
who
speak
not
to
the
historical
persons
but
to
the
listeners&nbspfurthermore
he&nbspsuggested
another
characteristic
of
modernity
–
time
consciousness
and
the
growing
importance
of
the
linear
progression
of
time
–
can
be
seen
between
the
different
temporal
levels
of
the
active
recitatives
and
seeming
pause
of
time
in
the
arias
as
well
as
in
bach’s
‘staging
of
recollection’
enhancing
the
listeners’
awareness
of
time
as
they
are
made
aware
of
their
retention
of
prior
motifs
as
these
are
reused
in
later
movements
making
connections
between
past
and
present
action
listening
became
a
key
theme
in
the
final
roundtable
discussion
of
the
day
as
ideas
were
sought
on
how
we
might
aim
to
better
understand
the
early
modern
listener
suggestions&nbspincluded
exploring&nbspthe
interaction
of
music
and
spectacle&nbspinvestigating
the
technology
and
instruments
behind
such
performances
trying
to
better
understand
the
responses
of
listener
to
individual
performances&nbspand
considering
the
power
of
the
audience
on
shaping
musical
and
theatrical
development
if
my
summary
of
the
day’s
events
has
sparked
your
interest
you’ll

the&nbspmeanings
of
an&nbspitalian
musical&nbspmarvel
in
early
modern
england
as
an
arachnophobe
the
last
thing
i
thought
i’d
end
up
writing
about
was
spiders
yet
having
had
to
get
over
my
reluctance
to
even
pick
up
a
book
with
a
spider
on
the
cover
that
is
exactly
where
my
current
project
exploring
musical
myths
has
taken
me
in
latesixteenth
century
england
a&nbsptale
began
to
circulate
concerning
music’s
ability
to
cure
the
bite
of
the
tarantula
a
particular
type
of
spider
found
in
the
apulia
region
of
italy
the
tarantula’s
poison
might
cause
various
effects
in
the
victim
–
including
laughing
weeping
silence
sleeping
raving
and
calling
out
delusions
melancholy
fearfulness
and
numbness
–
according
to
the
temperament
of
either
the
patient
or
the
spider
no
cure
was
to
be
found
except
music
musicians
had
to
find
the
right
tune
to
match
the
temperament
or
the
patient
and/or
the
temperament
of
the
spider
(which
was
also
believed
to
dance
to
a
specific
tune)
and
once
the
correct
tune
was
identified
the
patient
would
begin
to
dance
until
the
poison
was
expelled
the
patient
would
be
cured
but
the
illness
would
recur
each
year
requiring
the
same
musical
cure
until
it
was
often
said
the
tarantula
that
had
caused
the
bite
died
numerous
books
catalogued
the
tales
of
individual
victims
including
athanasius
kircher’s
magnes
siue
de
arte
magnetica
(rome
1641)
which
famously
transcribed
some
of
the
curative
tunes
(see
above)
but
why
was
this
story
about
an
italian
spider
significant
in
england?
here’s
a
little
taster
of
what
i’ve
been
finding
out
the
myth
was
probably
brought
into
england
via
castiglione’s
il
cortegiano
(1528)
and
began
to
circulate
widely
following
thomas
hoby’s
english
translation
(1561)
as
it
concerned
a
remote
corner
of
italy
few
englishmen
were
likely
to
visit
it
was
as
exotic
and
marvellous
as
tales
from
classical
mythology
and
it
especially
captured
the
imagination
of
courtly
writers
at
a
time
when
all
things
italian
were
in
fashion
at
the
elizabethan
court
sir
philip
sidney
for
example
uses
the
tarantula
as
a
metaphor
for
falling
in
love
in
the
countesse
of
pembrokes
arcadia
(1590)
the
word
‘lover’
pierces
pyrocles
just
as
music
touches
the
victim
of
the
tarantula
so
that
his
body
and
heart
‘seemed
to
dance
to
the
sound
of
that
word’
the
sting
of
cupid’s
arrow&nbspcauses
lovesickness
just
as
the
tarantula
bite
causes
the
victim
to
lose
control
of
mind
and
body
although
sidney
provides
no
musical
cure
for
his
character
the
tarantula
myth
was
most
obviously
an
example
of
music’s
healing
powers
a
particular
fascination
for&nbspphysicians
and
natural
philosphers
in
seventeenthcentury
england&nbspin
the
early
modern
world
the
most
common
explanation
for
illness
was
an
imbalance
of
the
four
humours
(black
bile/melancholy
yellow
bile/choler
phlegm
and
blood)
as
wellbeing
required
keeping
the
humours
in
balance
musical
metaphors
were
common
with
health
regarded
as
‘but
a
harmony
of
temperament
and
sicknesse
a
dissonancie’
(virgilio
malvezzi
david
persecuted
1650)
furthermore
music
was
widely
recognised
as
a
cure
for
madness
melancholy
(including
lovesickness)
and
as
able
to
drive
out
demons
(another
potential
cause
of
illness)
for
the
tarantula
bite
music’s
curative
powers
depended
on
the
effects
of
its
vibration
of
the
air
when
transferred
to
the
body
via
the
ear
physician
walter
charleton
described
the
venom
as
conveyed
by
a
‘thin
acrimonious
and
pricking
humor’
the
harmonious
movement
of
air
caused
by
the
music
was
received
by
ears&nbsptransported
by
the
spirits
until
it
agitated
the
humour
carrying
the
venom
this&nbspmade
parts
of
the
body
itch
causing
the
victim&nbspto
dance
and
the
‘pricking
humour’
to
be
sweated
out
(physiologia
epicurogassendocharltoniana
or
a
fabrick
of
science
natural
1654)
not
only
did
this
story
about
physical
disease
(a
tarantula
bite)
serve
as
a
metaphor
for
a
mental
affliction
(lovesickness)
but
it
also
become
a
favourite
of
religious
writers
concerned
with
music’s
ability
to
cure
diseases
of
the
soul
the
anonymous
‘university
pen’
who
wrote
the
spiritual
bee
(1662)
interpreted
dancing
as
an&nbspimmoral
symptom
of
the
bite
rather
than
the
cure
this
was
typical
of
how
the
tarantula
became
a
symbol
for
various
kinds
of
earthly
transgressions
including
drunkenness
and
frivolity
furthermore
the
author
considered
the
case
of
the
tarantula
victims
who
die
laughing
if
not
cured
by
music
to
be
‘much
the
same
who
are
bitten
by
that
infernal
serpent
all
whose
years
are
spent
in
mirth
and
their
days
in
laughter
but
in
a
moment
they
goe
down
unto
the
grave’
this
comparison
of
tarantulas
with
satan
was
helped
along
by
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
in
england
over
precisely
what
kind
of
a
creature
the
tarantula
actually
was
as
well
as
a
spider
it
was
variously
described
as
a
lizard
a
fly
an
eft
(a
small
lizardlike
creature)
and
a
serpent
the
last
of
these
offered
obvious
comparisons
with
the
serpent
of
the
garden
of
eden
and
by
extension
with
the
devil
himself
the
musical
cure
was
paralleled
in
the
spiritual
bee
with
the
harmonious
voice
of
god
(‘that
wise
charmer’)
who
can
cure
the
‘exorbitances
and
profusenesse
of
our
spirits
in
wordly
delights’
in
effect
rebalancing
the
temperament
of
the
soul
the
story
of
the
tarantula
bite
and
its
musical
cure
was
received
unquestioningly
in
england
until
the
investigations
of
the
royal
society
in
the
1670s
their
confidence
in
the
phenomenon
was
shaken
when
they
heard
the
opinion
of
the
neapolitan
physician
dr
thomas
cornelio
that
tarantism
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
bite
of
a
tarantula
but
was
simply
the
result
of
the
hot
dry
climate
yet
despite
the
evidence
of
a
fellow
intellectual
who
had
visited
the
region
and
studied
the
phenomenon&nbspmany
scientists
(including
robert
hooke
and
robert
boyle)
continued
to
believe
the
story
interestingly
however
neither
cornelio’s
demythologising
nor
boyle
and
hooke’s
commitment
to
its
veracity
tell
the
full
story
modern
studies
of
tarantism
have
shown
it
to
have
been
neither
a
legendary
phenomenon
nor
the
effect
of
a
spider
bite
nor
even
a
metal
disorder
but
rather
a
‘culturally
conditioned
symbolic
order’
in
which
a
particular
life
crisis
is
symbolically
remodelled
as
the
bite
of
a
tarantula
and
ritually
controlled
and
exorcised
through
rituals
of
music
and
dance
(de
martino
the
land
of
remorse)
such
a
medical
disorder
with
its
musical
cure
fits
uncomfortably
within
modern
perceptions
of
health
and
disease
let
alone
those
of
the
early
modern
england
yet
the
tarantula
myth
nevertheless
served
as
a
emblem
of
music’s
beneficial
properties
for
mind
body
and
soul

thomas
vautrollier
printed
his
recueil
du
mellange&nbspd’orlande
de
lassus
a
collection
of
lassus’s
chansons
it
was
only
the
second
music
publication
to
be
printed
in
england
(aside
from
psalm
books)
and
it
had
been
forty
years
since
the
last
one
(known
as
the
‘twenty
songs’&nbsp
and
published
1530
though
only
the
bass
partbook
and
a
few
fragments
survive)
vautrollier
was
a
huguenot
seeking
refuge
from
religious
persecution
in
france
he
saw
elizabeth’s
england
as
the
fulfilment
of
the
ideal
of
concordia&nbspdiscors&nbsp(harmony&nbspof
discords)
in
its
religious
tolerance
and
even
dedicated
his
print
to
the
earl
of
arundel
a
musical
patron
with
catholic
sympathies
praising
the
‘admirable
beauty
of
the
harmony’
in
states
that
temper
the
‘unified
diversity
of
their
various
parts’
vautrollier&nbspcompared
elizabeth’s
england
to
a
musical
motet
in
which
‘thanks
to
the
leading
of
one
part
all
others
hold
to
a
similar
measure’
making
no
discord
despite
their
differences
elizabeth
is
the
leading
part
that
keeps
all
the
estate
and
religious
faction
in
harmony
to
vautrollier
elizabeth’s
kingdom
was
an
example
to
other
nations
of
how
a
diversity
of
peoples
can
be
skilfully
governed
to
produce
a
stable
and
