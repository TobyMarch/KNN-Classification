with

those
influences
bubble
up
throughout
this
15track

of
the
younger
multiinstrumentalist
winter's

cd
this
2002
release
is
a
remastered
15
song
retrospective
of
his
5
epic
albums
it
includes
a
16
page
booklet
with
liner
notes
and
photos
the
diversity
of
his
music
is
amazing
clive
davis
gave
winter
lots
of
money
and
full
musical
freedom
to
sign
with
epic
which
edgar
took
full
advantage
of
his
first
stage
leaned
heavily
in
a
jazz
vein
and
then
he
entered
his
second
stage
by
forming
white
trash
with
the
extraordinary
vocal
talents
of
jerry
la
croix
white
trash
was
sort
of
a
cross
between
blues
brothers
style
blues
and
sly

the
family
stone
with
a
mix
of
rock
soul
blues
and
`honest
to
goodness'
gospel
then
he
went
into
a
pop/rock
direction
with
his
electronic
rock
smash
frankenstein
various
musicians
who
played
in
the
different
incarnations
include
rick
derringer
ronnie
montrose
dan
hartman
tommy
shannon
and
his
brother
johnny
one
thing
that
all
these
different
styles
of
music
do
share
is
that
they
are
all
sound
timeless
i
highly
recommend
this
cd

i've
liked
the
free
ride
song
since
i
heard
it
the
first
time
i
didn't
really
know
anything
about
the
edgar
winter
group
though
i
wanted
the
free
ride
song
to
make
a
ring
tone
for
my
phone
and
when
i
searched
for
it
this
album
and
some
others
came
up
on
my
screen
i
listened
to
all
the
free
samples
and
decided
to
buy
this
whole
album
in
mp3
because
all
the
samples
sounded
good
to
me
once
i
had
the
album
i
recognized
the
song
frankenstein
though
i
hadn't
known
the
name
of
the
music
overall
i'm
very
happy
with
the
album
and
am
enjoying
listening
to
it
and
i
am
very
happy
