the
current
jefferson

led
by
cofounder
paul
kantner
more
closely
resembles
its

than
the
popdriven

for
in
the

mid1980s
it
is
not
to
be
confused
with

and
included
the
hit
song
with

(#12)
the
band
considered
the
album's
sales
to
be
relatively
disappointing
compared
to
its
predecessor
and
requested
an
audit
from
rca

soon
follow
balin's
reluctance
to
tour
had
kept
the
band
off
the
road
for
over
a
year
and
slick's
alcoholism
increasingly
became
a
problem
which
led
to
two
consecutive
nights
of
disastrous
concerts
in
germany
in
june
1978[3]
on
the
first
night
fans
ransacked
the
stage
when
slick
and
the
band
failed
to
appear
on
the
second
night
slick
in
a
drunken
stupor
shocked
the
audience
by
swearing
and
making
sexual
references
throughout
most
of
her
songs
she
also
reminded
the
audience
that
their
country
had
lost
world
war
ii
repeatedly
asking
who
won
the
war?
and
implied
that
all
residents
of
germany
were
responsible
for
the
wartime
atrocities[4][5]
after
the
debacle
kantner
asked
for
slick's
resignation
from
the
band
towards
the
end
of

would
appear
frequently
on

such
musicoriented
television
shows
as

giving
the

a
high
visibility
in

although
the
