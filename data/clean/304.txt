deep
purple
are
an
english
rock
band
formed
in
hertford
in
1968[1]
they
are
considered
to
be
among
the
pioneers
of
heavy
metal
and
modern
hard
rock[2][3]
although
their
musical
approach
changed
over
the
years[4]
originally
formed
as
a
progressive
rock
band
the
band's
sound
shifted
to
hard
rock
in
1970
deep
purple
together
with
led
zeppelin
and
black
sabbath
have
been
referred
to
as
the
unholy
trinity
of
british
hard
rock
and
heavy
metal
in
the
early
to
midseventies[5]
they
were
listed
in
the
1975
guinness
book
of
world
records
as
the
globe's
loudest
band
for
a
1972
concert
at
london's
rainbow
theatre[6][7]
and
have
sold
over
100&nbspmillion
albums
worldwide[8][9][10][11]
including
8
million
certified
units
in
the
us[12]
the
band
has
gone
through
many
lineup
changes
and
an
eightyear
hiatus
(1976–1984)
the
1968–1976
lineups
are
commonly
labelled
mark
i
ii
iii
and
iv[13][14]
their
second
and
most
commercially
successful
lineup
featured
ian
gillan
(vocals)
jon
lord
(organ)
roger
glover
(bass)
ian
paice
(drums)
and
ritchie
blackmore
(guitar)
this
lineup
was
active
from
1969
to
1973
and
was
revived
from
1984
to
1989
and
again
from
1992
to
1993
the
band
achieved
more
modest
success
in
the
intervening
periods
between
1968
and
1969
with
the
lineup
including
rod
evans
(vocals)
and

simper
(bass
backing
vocals)
between
1974
and
1976
(tommy

the
band's
lineup
(currently
featuring
ian
gillan
and
guitarist
steve
morse
from
1994)
has
been
much
more
stable
in
recent
years
although
organist
jon
lord's
retirement
from
the

in
2002
(being

(1967–68)
[edit]
in
1967
former
searchers
drummer
chris
curtis
contacted
london
businessman
tony
edwards
in
the
hope
that
he
would
manage
a
new
group
he
was
putting
together
to
be
called
roundabout
curtis'
vision
was
a
supergroup
where
the
band
members
would
get
on
and
off
like
a
musical
roundabout
impressed
with
the
plan
edwards
agreed
to
finance
the
venture
with
two
business
partners
john
coletta
and
ron
hire
all
of
hireedwardscoletta
(hec)
enterprises[19]
the
first
recruit
was
the
classicallytrained
hammond
organ
player
jon
lord
curtis'
flatmate
who
had
most
notably
played
with
the
artwoods
(led
by
art
wood
brother
of
future
rolling
stones
guitarist
ronnie
wood
and
featuring
keef
hartley)[20]
he
was
followed
by
guitarist
ritchie
blackmore
who
was
persuaded
to
return
from
hamburg
to
audition
for
the
new
group
blackmore
was
making
a
name
for
himself
as
a
studio
session
guitarist
and
had
also
been
a
member
of
the
outlaws
screaming
lord
sutch
and
neil
christian
curtis'
erratic
behaviour
soon
forced
him
out
of
his
own
project
but
lord
and
blackmore
were
keen
to
continue
and
carried
on
recruiting
additional
members
keeping
tony
edwards
as
their
manager[21]

—
ritchie
blackmore
on
choosing
the
band's
name[22]
for
the
bass
guitar
lord
suggested
his
old
friend
nick
simper
with
whom
he
had
played
in
a
band
called
the
flower
pot
men
and
their
garden
(formerly
known
as
the
ivy
league)
back
in
1967
simper
had
previously
been
in
johnny
kidd
and
the
pirates
and
survived
the
car
crash
that
killed
kidd
simper
had
known
blackmore
since
the
early
1960s
when
his
first
band
the
renegades
debuted
around
the
same
time
as
one
of
blackmore's
early
bands
the
dominators[23]
bobby
woodman
was
the
initial
choice
for
the
drums
but
during
the
auditions
for
a
singer
rod
evans
of
the
maze
came
in
with
his
drummer
ian
paice
blackmore
had
seen
paice
on
tour
with
the
maze
in
germany
in
1966
and
had
been
impressed
by
the
18year
old's
drumming
while
woodman
was
out
for
cigarettes
blackmore
quickly
arranged
an
audition
for
paice
both
paice
and
evans
won
their
respective
jobs
and
the
lineup
was
complete[24]
the
band
began
in
earnest
in
march
1968
at
deeves
hall
a
country
house
in
south
mimms
hertfordshire[25][26]
the
band
would
live
write
and
rehearse
at
deeves
hall
which
was
fully
kitted
out
with
the
latest
marshall
amplification[22]
after
a
brief
tour
of
denmark
and
sweden
in
april
in
which
they
were
still
billed
as
roundabout
blackmore
suggested
a
new
name
deep
purple
named
after
his
grandmother's
favourite
song[21][22]
the
group
had
resolved
to
choose
a
name
after
everyone
had
posted
one
on
a
board
in
rehearsal
second
to
deep
purple
was
concrete
god
which
the
band
thought
was
too
harsh
to
take
on[27][28]

the
band
moved
into
pye
studios
in
london's
marble
arch
to
record
their
debut
album
shades
of
deep
purple
which
was
released
in
july[29]
the
group
had
success
in
north
america
with
a
cover
of
joe
south's
hush
and
by
september
1968
the
song
had
reached
number
4
on
the
billboard
hot
100
in
the
us
and
number
2
on
the
canadian
rpm
charts
pushing
the
shades
lp
up
to
no&nbsp24
on
billboard's
pop
album
charts[30][31]
the
following
month
deep
purple
was
booked
to
support
cream
on
their
goodbye
tour[30]
the
band's
second
album
the
book
of
taliesyn
(including
a
cover
of
neil
diamond's
kentucky
woman)
was
released
in
north
america
to
coincide
with
the
tour
reaching
number
38
on
the
billboard
charts
and
number
21
on
the
rpm
charts
although
it
would
not
be
released
in
their
home
country
until
the
following
year
early
1969
saw
deep
purple
record
their
third
album
simply
titled
deep
purple
the
album
contained
strings
and
woodwind
on
one
track
(april)
showcasing
lord's
classical
antecedents
such
as
bach
and
rimskykorsakov
and
several
other
influences
were
in
evidence
notably
vanilla
fudge
(lord
and
blackmore
had
even
claimed
the
group
wanted
to
be
a
vanilla
fudge
clone)[32]
not
satisfied
with
the
possibilities
for
singles
off
this
album
the
band
also
recorded
a
single
called
emmaretta
named
after
emmaretta
marks
then
a
cast
member
of
the
musical
hair
whom
evans
was
trying
to
seduce
this
would
be
the
last
recording
by
the
original
lineup[33]
deep
purple's
troubled
north
american
record
label
tetragrammaton
delayed
production
of
the
deep
purple
album
until
after
the
band's
1969
american
tour
ended
this
as
well
as
lackluster
promotion
by
the
nearlybroke
label
caused
the
album
to
sell
poorly
finishing
well
out
of
the
billboard
top
100
soon
after
the
third
album's
eventual
release
tetragrammaton
went
out
of
business
leaving
the
band
with
no
money
and
an
uncertain
future
(tetragrammaton's
assets
were
assumed
by
warner
bros
records
who
would
release
deep
purple's
records
in
the
us
throughout
the
1970s)
during
the
1969
american
tour
lord
and
blackmore
met
with
paice
to
discuss
their
desire
to
take
the
band
in
a
heavier
direction
feeling
that
evans
and
simper
would
not
fit
well
with
a
heavy
rock
style
both
were
replaced
that
summer[34]
paice
stated
a
change
had
to
come
if
they
hadn't
left
the
band
would
have
totally
disintegrated[24]
as
ritchie
blackmore
explained
it
nicky
wasn’t
constructive
he
didn’t
have
any
ideas
and
he
was
an
average
bass
player
so
he
had
to
go
rod
just
wanted
to
go
to
america
and
live
in
america[35]
ritchie
blackmore
in
hannover
germany
1970
in
search
of
a
replacement
vocalist
blackmore
set
his
own
sights
on
19yearold
singer
terry
reid
though
he
found
the
offer
flattering
reid
was
still
bound
by
the
exclusive
recording
contract
with
his
producer
mickie
most
and
more
interested
in
his
solo
career[36]
blackmore
had
no
other
choice
but
to
look
elsewhere
the
band
hunted
down
singer
ian
gillan
from
episode
six
a
band
that
had
released
several
singles
in
the
uk
without
achieving
their
big
break
for
commercial
success
gillan
had
at
one
time
been
approached
by
nick
simper
when
deep
purple
was
first
forming
but
gillan
had
reportedly
told
simper
that
the
roundabout
project
would
not
go
anywhere
while
he
felt
episode
six
was
poised
to
make
it
big[37]
six's
drummer
mick
underwood
–
an
old
comrade
of
blackmore's
from
his
days
in
the
outlaws
–
introduced
the
band
to
gillan
and
bassist
roger
glover
this
effectively
killed
episode
six
and
gave
underwood
a
guilt
complex
that
lasted
nearly
a
decade
until
gillan
recruited
him
for
his
new
postpurple
band
in
the
late
1970s
according
to
blackmore
deep
purple
was
only
interested
in
gillan
and
not
glover
but
roger
was
retained
on
the
advice
of
ian
paice
he
turned
up
for
the
sessionhe
was
their
[episode
six's]
bass
player
we
weren’t
originally
going
to
take
him
until
paicey
said
“he’s
a
good
bass
player
let’s
keep
him”
so
i
said
okay
“
”
—
ritchie
blackmore
on
the
hiring
of
roger
glover[35]
this
created
the
deep
purple
mark
ii
lineup
whose
first
release
was
a
greenawaycook
tune
titled
hallelujah[38]
despite
tv
appearances
to
promote
the
record
in
the
uk
the
song
flopped[38]
blackmore
had
told
the
record
mirror
they
need
to
have
a
commercial
record
in
britain
and
described
the
song
as
an
inbetween
sort
of
thing—a
median
between
what
the
band
would
normally
make
but
with
an
added
commercial
motive[38]
the
band
gained
some
muchneeded
publicity
in
september
1969
with
the
concerto
for
group
and
orchestra
a
threemovement
epic
composed
by
lord
as
a
solo
project
and
performed
by
the
band
at
the
royal
albert
hall
with
the
royal
philharmonic
orchestra
conducted
by
malcolm
arnold[30]
together
with
five
bridges
by
the
nice
it
was
one
of
the
first
collaborations
between
a
rock
band
and
an
orchestra
this
live
album
became
their
first
album
with
any
kind
of
chart
success
in
the
uk[39]
however
gillan
and
blackmore
especially
were
less
than
happy
at
the
band
being
tagged
as
a
group
who
played
with
orchestras
at
the
time
what
they
had
in
mind
was
to
develop
the
band
into
a
much
tighter
hardrocking
style
despite
this
lord
wrote
the
gemini
suite
another
orchestra/group
collaboration
in
the
same
vein
for
the
band
in
late
1970
in
1975
blackmore
stated
that
he
thought
the
concerto
for
group
and
orchestra
wasn’t
bad
but
the
gemini
suite
was
horrible
and
very
disjointed[40]
roger
glover
later
claimed
jon
lord
had
appeared
to
be
the
leader
of
the
band
in
the
early
years[41]

us
1972
shortly
after
the
orchestral
release
deep
purple
began
a
hectic
touring
and
recording
schedule
that
was
to
see
little
respite
for
the
next
three
years
their
first
studio
album
of
this
period
released
in
mid1970
was
in

(a

supported
by
the
album's
mount

cover)
which
contained
the
thenconcert
staples
speed
king
into
the
fire
and
child
in
time
the
band
also
issued
the
single
black
night
which
finally
put
deep
purple
into
the
uk
top
ten[42]
the
interplay
between
blackmore's
guitar
and
lord's
distorted
organ
coupled
with
gillan's
howling
vocals
and
the
rhythm
section
of
glover
and
paice
now
started
to
take
on
a
unique
identity
that
further
separated
the
band
from
its
earlier
albums

with

and

genre[2]
on
the
album's
development
blackmore
stated
i
got
fed
up
with
playing
with
classical
orchestras
and
thought
well
this
is
my
turn
jon
was
into
more
classical
i
thought
well
you
do
that
i'll
do
rock
and
i
said
if
this
fails
this
record
i'll
play
with
orchestras
the
rest
of
my
life[43]
in

performed
well
especially
in
the
uk
where
it
reached
#4
while
the
black

single
reached
#2
and
the
band
performed
the
song
live
on
the
bbc's
top
of
the
pops[44]
a
second
album
the
creatively
progressive
fireball
was
issued
in
the
summer
of
1971
the
title
track
fireball
was
released
as
a
single
as
was
strange
kind
of
woman
not
from
the

but
recorded
during
the

sessions
(although
it
replaced
demon's

on
the

version
of
the

within
weeks
of
fireball's
release
the
band
were
already
performing
songs
planned
for
the
next

one
song
(which
later
became
highway
star)
was
performed
at
the
first
gig
of

been
written
on

deep

at
a
rate
that
would
be
rare
thirty
years
on

the

internal
tensions
and

were
more

[edit]
ian
gillan
admitted
in
a
1984
interview
that
the
band
was
pushed
by
management
to
complete
the
who
do
we
think
we
are
album
on
time
and
go
on
tour
although
they
badly
needed
a
break[55]
the
bad
feelings
culminated
in
gillan
followed
by
glover
quitting
the
band
after
their
second
tour
of
japan
in
the
summer
of
1973
over
tensions
with
blackmore[56][57][58]
david
coverdale
vocalist
between
august
1973
and
march
1976
the
band
first
hired
midlands
bassist/vocalist
glenn
hughes
formerly
of
trapeze
according
to
ian
paice
glover
had
told
him
and
lord
a
few
months
before
his
official
resignation
that
he
wanted
to
leave
the
band
so
they
had
already
started
to
drop
in
on
trapeze
shows
after
acquiring
hughes
they
debated
continuing
as
a
fourpiece
band
with
hughes
as
both
bassist
and
lead
vocalist[59][60]
according
to
hughes
he
was
persuaded
to
join
under
the
guise
that
the
band
would
be
bringing
in
paul
rodgers
of
free
as
a
colead
vocalist
but
by
that
time
rodgers
had
just
started
bad
company[61]
instead
auditions
were
held
for
lead
vocal
replacements
they
settled
on
david
coverdale
an
unknown
singer
from
saltburn
in
northeast
england
primarily
because
blackmore
liked
his
masculine
bluestinged
voice[60]
this
new
lineup
continued
into
1974
and
their
spring
tour
included
shows
at
madison
square
garden
new
york
on
13
march
and
nassau
coliseum
four
days
later[62]
the
band
then
headlined
the
famous
california
jam
festival
at
ontario
motor
speedway
located
in
southern
california
on
6
april
1974
attracting
over
250000[63]

the

portions
of
the

were
telecast
on
abc
television
in
the
us
exposing
the
band
to
a
wider
audience
this
lineup's
first
album
titled
burn
was
a
highly
successful
release
(only
the
second
studio
album
after
machine
head
to
crack
the
us
top
10)
and
was
followed
by
another
world
tour
the
title
track
burn
which
opens
the
album
was
a
conscious
effort
by
the
band
to
embrace
the
progressive
rock
movement
that
was
popularized
at
the
time
by
bands
such
as
yes
elp
genesis
gentle
giant
etc
burn
was
a
complex
arrangement
which
showcased
all
the
band
members'
musical
virtuosity
and
particularly
blackmore's
classicallyinfluenced
guitar
prowess
the
album
also
featured
hughes
and
coverdale
providing
vocal
harmonies
and
elements
of
funk
and
blues
respectively
to
the
band's
music
a
sound
that
was
even
more
apparent
on
the
late
1974
release
stormbringer[60]
besides
the
title
track
the
stormbringer
album
had
a
number
of
songs
that
received
much
radio
play
such
as
lady
double
dealer
the
gypsy
and
soldier
of
fortune
however
blackmore
publicly
disliked
the
album
and
the
funky
soul
elements
even
calling
it
shoeshine
music[64][65][66]
as
a
result
he
left
the
band
on
21
june
1975
to
form
his
own
band
with
ronnie

of
the
biggest

vacancies
in

in
spite
of
this
the
rest
of
the

refused
to
stop

at

two
versions
about
the

of

claims
to
have
been
the

andthe
job
was
his
but
in
an
interview
originally
published
by

maker
in
june
1975
bolin
himself
claimed
that
he
came
to
the
audition
following
a
recommendation
from
blackmore[70]
bolin
had
been
a
member
of
many
nowforgotten
late1960s
bands
–
denny

the

american
standard
and
zephyr
which
released
three
albums
from
1969–72
before

recordings
were
made
as
a

on

and
as
lead
guitarist
on
two

he
had
also
jammed
with
such
luminaries
as
dr

moxy
and
alphonse

and
was
busy
working
on
his

accepted
the

to
join

the
resulting

album
despite
mixed
reviews
and
soso
sales
(#19
on
the
uk
charts
and
#43
on
the

the
collection
revitalised
the
band
once
again
bringing
a
new
extreme
funk
edge
to
their
hard
rock
sound[72]
bolin's
influence
was
crucial
and
with
encouragement
from
hughes
and
coverdale
the
guitarist
developed
much
of
the
album's
material
later
bolin's
personal

began
to

themselves

emi
records
refused

by

with
a
bit
of

thrown
in[122]
in

there

prior
to
october
2012
deep
purple
had
not
been
nominated
for
induction
into
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
(as
they've
been
eligible
since
1993)
but
were
nominated
for
induction
in
2012
and
2013[125][126]
despite
ranking
2nd
in
the
public's
vote
on
the
rock
hall
fans’
ballot
which
had
over
half
a
million
votes
they
were
not
inducted
by
the
rock
hall
committee[127]
kiss
bassist
gene
simmons
and
rush
vocalist
geddy
lee
commented
that
deep
purple
should
obviously
be
among
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
inductees[128][129]
there
have
been
criticisms
in
the
past
over
deep
purple
not
having
been
inducted
toto
guitarist
steve
lukather
commented
they
put
patti
smith
in
there
but
not
deep
purple?
what's
the
first
song
every
kid
learns
how
to
play?
[smoke
on
the
water]and
they're
not
in
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame?
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
has
lost
its
cool
because
of
the
glaring
omissions[130]
former
guns
n'
roses
guitarist
slash
expressed
his
surprise
and
disagreement
for
the
noninduction
of
deep
purple
the
list
of
people
who
haven’t
even
been
nominated
is
mindboggling(the)
big
one
for
me
is
deep
purple
how
could
you
not
induct
deep
purple?[131][132]
when
asked
what
band
he'd
like
to
see
inducted
into
the
rock
hall
metallica
drummer
lars
ulrich
also
singled
out
deep
purple[133]
metallica
guitarist
kirk
hammett
commented
i've
been
lobbying
for
deep
purple
for
a
long
long
time
if
black
sabbath
can
be
in
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
deep
purple
definitely
belongs
in
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
'cause
they
had
great
songs
great
musicianship
they
had
an
impact
and
they're
a
huge
influence
on
the
heavy
metal
community
as
a
whole
so
i
definitely
think
that
they
belong
in
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame[134]
in
response
to
these
a
hall
of
fame
chief
executive
said
the
definition
of
‘rock
and
roll’
means
different
things
to
different
people
but
as
broad
as
the
classifications
may
be
they
all
share
a
common
love
of
the
music[128]
deep
purple
vocalist
ian
gillan
also
commented
to
us
with
the
greatest
respect
it
doesn't
mean
a
lot
although
it's
rather
like
an
award
in
the
uk
if
i
were
to
get
one
i
probably
wouldn't
accept
it
but
then
again
after
a
week
of
thinking
about
it
i
would
accept
it
because
it
would
be
on
behalf
of
the
family
and
friends
and
everyone
who
supports
the
band
and
who's
looked
after
us
after
all
these
years
it's
kind
of
a
recognition
of
everyone
but
whether
we
deserve
it
i
don't
know
i
always
get
embarrassed
talking
about
this
stuff[134]
