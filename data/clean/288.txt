cd
below
is
a
letter
from
tom
scholz
posted
on
bostonorg
regarding
the
remastering
of
this
album
and
the
followup
don't
look
back
but
before
i
get
to
that
i
have
a
few
comments
i
have
loved
this
album
since
it's
debut
in
1976
and
i
have
always
felt
that
the
last
song
let
me
take
you
home
tonight
sounded
different
from
the
other
songs
and
now
the
liner
notes
of
the
remastered
boston
verify
that
belief
on
all
of
the
other
songs
with
few
exceptions
tom
scholz
played
all
instruments
except
drums
barry
played
a
lead
here
and
fran
played
a
bass
there
but
that
is
about
it
that
is
except
for
let
me
take
you
home
tonight
where
tom
only
played
the
organ
i
mention
this
because
i
remember
folks
complaining
about
third
stage
and
walk
on
stating
that
they
could
tell
a
difference
between
these
latter
albums
which
noted
tom
as
the
player
of
most
of
the
instruments
and
the
earlier
ones
where
boston
was
a
band
little
did
they
know
that
it
was
the
same
method
a
letter
from
tom
scholz
regarding
the
newly
remastered
debut
album
and
don't
look
back!
what
the
deuce
is
up
with
boston?
my
apologies
to
you
all
for
the
unintentional
silence
about
boston
activities
and
plans
especially
concerning
a
reissue
of
the
first
two
boston
albums
oddly
enough
i
was
just
beginning
a
letter
like
this
when
that
topic
jumped
onto
my
computer
forcing
me
to
drop
everything
including
communicating
with
all
of
you
so
now
you
know
i
do
see
postings
on
these
sites!
not
all
of
them
but
enough
to
know
your
collective
feelings
about
boston
and
btw
thank
you
even
though
half
of
what
i
read
is
dead
wrong
and
the
other
half
i
disagree
with
(you
knew
i
was
hard
to
please)
it's
really
gratifying
to
know
that
so
many
people
appreciate
this
music
and
the
message
behind
it
those
of
you
who
just
write
to
say
encouraging
things
please
believe
that
you
have
saved
me
from
giving
up
many
times!
so
after
the
2004
boston
tour
ended
i
set
about
recording
some
new
material
some
of
it
sounds
more
like
old
boston
some
sounds
more
like
later
albums
all
of
it
has
me
excited
unfortunately
i
was
hampered
from
working
effectively
in
the
studio
by
complications
from
a
back
injury
in
2003
it
seems
i
may
have
been
the
victim
of
something
my
doctor
referred
to
as
acetaminophen
poisoning
i
used
tylenol
regularly
on
and
off
the
tours
for
some
time
and
as
i
have
since
read
about
this
apparently
may
have
wreaked
havoc
with
the
health
of
some
important
organs
no
i
don't
mean
the
hammond
or
the
pipe
organ
i
mean
mine
fortunately
i'm
now
doing
much
better
and
back
to
full
strength
and
full
speed
in
the
studiook
i
know
what
you're
thinking
just
keep
it
to
yourself!
i
had
to
hold
up
recording
for
a
couple
of
weeks
last
year
for
some
overdue
studio
repairs
three
months
later
i
was
nearly
finished
soldering
drilling
and
banging
when
i
discovered
the
announced
sony
legacy
boston
reissue
on
line
(funny
how
exband
members
who
haven't
played
in
boston
for
25
years
knew
about
these
plans
ahead
of
time)
i
was
mildly
surprised
to
find
out
that
two
albums
embodying
all
of
my
writing
performing
producing
and
engineering
work
from
the
70's
had
been
remastered
by
someone
i
didn't
know
with
added
live
recordings
mixed
by
someone
else
i
didn't
know
and
i
hadn't
even
heard
it!
when
i
finally
did
hear
it
i
wished
i
hadn't
although
i
got
used
to
getting
screwed
royally
by
business
types
in
the
music
world
the
audacity
of
this
particularly
inconsiderate
liberty
with
my
art
got
my
attention
very
quickly
although
i
was
pretty
sure
there
had
been
a
violation
of
my
rights
using
the
name
boston
for
this
abomination
i
decided
to
try
the
diplomatic
peaceful
approach
averting
another
war
and
creating
something
really
valuable
in
the
process
a
comprehensive
remastering
of
the
two
oldest
albums
to
bring
the
old
mixes
up
to
the
standards
of
21st
century
recordings
fortunately
my
real
manager
did
a
great
job
of
quickly
getting
legacy
to
see
my
point
of
view
and
change
their
plans
now
i
know
there
are
those
of
you
who
would
go
out
and
spend
good
money
(oxymoron)
for
anything
that
says
new
unreleased
boston
but
before
you
go
off
on
me
for
committing
new
releasus
interuptus
i
want
you
to
know
you
owe
me
big
time!
the
so
called
new
material
consisted
of
two
philly
kbfh
(despite
what
you
may
have
read
elsewhere)
notourbestnight
renditions
of
smokin'
and
fply/lt
plus
a
trashy
discard
i
used
to
toss
in
on
the
first
tour
'cause
we
didn't
have
enough
music
for
a
full
set!
they
didn't
even
have
the
name
right!
these
bonus
track
mixes
were
obviously
not
made
by
boston
hearing
the
huge
stereo
boston
mix
style
suddenly
disappear
when
the
live
cuts
started
was
a
little
scary
(even
our
live
sound
is
carefully
mixed
in
wide
stereo
as
most
of
you
know
first
hand)
but
the
real
kicker
was
a
technical
problem
with
brad's
vocal
track
that
showed
up
as
a
very
distracting
constant
weird
phasing
and
that
wasn't
the
worst
part
the
studio
recordings
were
just
transfers
to
digital
using
the
same
eq
moves
i
prescribed
for
mastering
them
30
years
ago
when
everything
had
to
be
done
manually
and
not
very
precisely
by
modern
standards
not
only
could
i
hear
no
improvement
the
overly
hot
sibilant
portions
that
were
listenable
on
vinyl
and
tape
were
now
nailsonblackboard
piercing
anyway
if
you
haven't
figured
it
out
yet
i
didn't
like
it
one
good
thing
though
thinking
about
live
boston
made
me
realize
i
have
to
dig
out
some
tapes
and
put
together
some
high
quality
mixes
of
our
tour
arrangements
some
of
them
were
totally
cool
dude
so
we
got
sony
to
retransfer
from
the
original
stereo
analogue
mix
tapes
(not
the
eq'd
2nd
gen
copy
companies
tend
to
use)
to
24
bit
digital
and
went
to
work
in
protools
going
over
every
second
of
those
mixes
til
we
were
nearly
batty
it
took
bill
ryan
and
me
eight
straight
long
days
of
work
which
btw
was
precisely
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
fl
keys
celebrating
my
birthday
finally
we
made
the
final
adjustments
with
toby
mountain
at
northeastern
digital
then
i
joined
kim
hart
and
gary
pihl
working
on
the
photos
and
booklet
layout
revisions
i
think
you'll
like
the
new
pics
somewhere
in
between
i
wrote
a
little
bit
about
the
famous
demo
and
the
making
of
the
first
album
i
call
make
extra
money
working
at
home
in
your
own
basement
and
also
clarified
and
expanded
the
credits
sections
david
wild
of
rolling
stone
fame
also
wrote
an
excellent
piece
from
a
fan's
perspective
for
each
album
but
the
exciting
story
is
what
you're
going
to
hear
when
you
put
this
cd
in
your
player
the
difference
is
amazing
to
me
the
guitars
jump
out
of
the
speakers
on
those
power
chords
brad's
voice
is
full
and
warm
in
the
mix
like
it
should
have
been
the
bass
is
tight
and
now
you
not
only
hear
it
you
feel
it!
i
never
liked
these
old
mixes
on
16
bit
cd
now
they
sound
great
hopefully
most
of
you
will
listen
to
this
directly
from
the
cd
not
an
mp3!
don't
get
me
startednow
exactly
when
that
will
be
possible
via
actual
release
sony
is
not
saying
but
they
were
in
enough
of
a
hurry
to
ruin
my
bday
vacation
so
presumably
it
will
be
very
soon
most
recent
rumor
mid
may
btw
lest
you
think
i'm
trumpeting
here
to
get
sales
up
be
assured
brad
and
i
don't
get
treated
any
better
financially
from
this
than
we
did
form
the
original
release
you
don't
think
that
just
because
we
wrote
it
performed
most
of
the
tracks
and
produced
it
we
get
most
of
the
money
do
you?
but
it
was
worth
taking
the
time
for
this
i've
always
wanted
to
make
those
albums
sound
good
on
cd
and
the
chance
arrived
it's
good
to
work
on
your
birthday

you
are
reading
this
i
hope
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
purchase
this
cd
you
are
probably
inordinately
familiar
with
the
album
it
is
an
album
like
rumours
or
saturday
night
fever
or
frampton
comes
alive
which
captures
and
defines
the
best
and
worst
of
an
era
it
sounds
like
nothing
else
of
the
time
sure
it
has
a
little
queen
a
little
southern
boogie
a
little
elo
evenbut
it's
a
boston
sound
through
and
through
there's
no
need
to
address
the
individual
songs
you
know
them
you
love
them
you
have
them
memorized
you
know
that
the
end
of
the
album
gets
a
little
weak
but
you
probably
kept
replaying
that
one
side
anyways
or
at
least
most
of
the
time
so
the
big
question
ishow
well
is
the
remastering
done?
well
you
know
how
some
remastering
cleans
things
up
with
such
detail
and
precision
you
feel
like
you
are
in
the
studio?
or
they
expand
the
soundstage
that
you
can
see
the
players
in
their
respective
position?
or
the
studio
trickery
comes
alive
inside
your
headphones
making
your
eyeballs
swirl?
not
here
which
is
perfect
what
scholz
and
company
have
done
is
restore
and
preserve
the
original
warm
sound
no
more
pops
clicks
or
scratches
no
more
tape
hiss
from
your
old
8tracks
or
cassettes
the
album
never
sounded
live
to
begin
with
there
are
no
dramatic
swoops
no
bizarre
effects
the
songs
are
mixed
as
a
whole
vocals
are
overdubbed
guitars
are
processedthis
is
not
an
attempt
at
reality
this
is
rock
and
roll
fantasy
and
as
such
it
works
phenomenally
well
the
instruments
are
warm
and
clear
the
vocals
soar
operatically
you'll
sing
along
in
your
car
or
on
your
ipod
in
embarrassing
fashion
and
you'll
airguitar
about
half
a
dozen
times
you
won't
be
able
to
resist
you'll
recall
all
the
fun
you
had
in
the
seventies
and
none
of
the
bad
fashion
or
haircuts
time
to
buy
now
have
a
nice
day!

cd
classic
70's
albums
bring
into
mind
fleetwood
mac's
rumours
led
zeppelin's
fourth
album
and
blondie's
parallel
lines
to
name
a
few
add
to
that
boston's
debut
album
which
sold
16
million
copies
in
the
us
and
was
in
the
album
charts
for
two
years
much
of
the
success
was
due
to
the
intelligent
songwriting
of
tom
scholz
and
rock
vocals
of
brad
delp
who
by
the
time
of
their
third
album
third
stage
were
the
only
two
from
the
original
lineup
left
the
remembrances
of
summers
past
and
a
girl
named
marianne
is
embodied
in
their
first
single
more
than
a
feeling
one
of
the
best
known
rock
singles
of
the
70's
reaching
#5
in
1976
it
featured
all
the
components
that
made
boston
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
delp's
soaring
vocals
accompaniment
from
other
members
and
tom
scholz's
distinctive
squealing
and
revved
guitars
particularly
during
the
chorus
peace
of
mind
the
third
single
which
barely
showed
its
face
in
the
top
40
(#38)
is
more
a
rocker
throughout
it's
a
song
showing
the
wisdom
of
not
getting
caught
up
with
the
fierce
competition
in
the
music
world
/can'tcha
you
see
there'll
come
a
day
when
it
won't
matter/come
a
day
when
you'll
be
gone/
i
sometimes
find
myself
liking
this
song
more
than
more
than
a
feeling
why
didn't
this
get
into
the
top
5
as
well?
the
second
single
long
time
has
as
an
accompanying
prelude
foreplay
with
its
rambling
organ
solo
and
snarling
guitars
after
2
mins
23
seconds
long
time
begins
with
a
squealing
guitar
and
brad
singing
this
#22
song
has
the
longterm
dream
or
vision
much
like
peace
of
mind
and
the
need
to
move
on
from
one
place
to
another
to
find
it
the
got
to
move
on
dynamic
is
also
explored
in
hitch
a
ride
only
on
a
more
cosmic
level
where
hitching
a
ride
to
the
other
side
and
leaving
for
the
last
time
is
the
final
departure
rock
n
roll
band
is
an
autobiographic
song
of
how
the
band
made
it
from
local
gigs
till
their
discovery
just
as
engaging
if
not
more
than
peace
of
mind
there
are
some
nods
to
oldfashion
rr
in
the
verses
of
the
jamming
smokin'
jamming
or
should
i
say
smoking?
all
the
songs
are
singleworthy
due
to
a
consistent
strong
guitar
heavy
bass
drums
in
other
words
the
forerunner
of
what
would
later
be
termed
arena
rock
corporate
rock
is
another
term
that
comes
to
mind
although
later
boston's
most
recent
album
would
be
named
corporate
america
in
denunciation
of
the
type
of
music
his
band
had
been
a
part
of
not
many
artists
have
a
bestselling
pop
debut
album
like
boston
although
two
that
come
to
mind
are
whitney
houston
and
hootie

the

classic
that
still
hasn't
lost
