a
shift
to
an
electronic

and
synthesizers
featured
in

this
style
would
continue
to
evolve

one
track
recorded
in

it
was
a
much
more
pronounced
electronic
album
the
album
became
a
success
mostly
due

kevin

singing

in
baltimore
in
2007
the
group
has
a
style
that
is
typical
of
many
elephant
6
bands
due
to
its
interest
in
combining
musical
experimentation
and
the
basic
tenets
of
pop
such
as
catchy
melodies
and
singalong
choruses
the
band's
style
has
been
influenced
by
not
only
more
conventional
indie
pop
and
psychedelic
music
but
also
by
vaudeville
and

embraced
a
more
simple
quirky
lofi
indie
pop
sound
which
occasionally
bordered
on
twee

later
the
band
moved
to
a
fuller
sound
as
seen
on
the
concept
albums
the
gay
parade
and
its
followup

a
variety
of
whimsical

2004's
satanic

the

the

shifted
to
something
more
electronic
although
at
this
point
still
with
more
standard
instrumentation
and
prominent

on
most
tracks
with
more
traditional
pop
and
rock
structures
to
be
further
advanced
in

in
