back
in
2005
the
year
of
their
stellar
debut
album
silent
alarm
bloc
party
truly
felt
invincible
the
british
quartet
wrangled
explosive
melodrama
from
the
simplest
of
rock
’n’
roll
tools
the
crossfire
guitars
of
kele
okereke
and
russell
lissack
the
caffeinated
rhythmic
thrust
of
bassist
gordon
moakes
and
drummer
matt
tong
and
okereke’s
snotty
livewire
yelp
every
song
felt
like
an
urgent
mission
statement
delivered
with
razorsharp
chops
and
a
blindsiding
emotional
wallop
it
was
funky
yet
punky
heavy
yet
elegant
familiar
yet
totally
fresh
it
was
also
the
first
chapter
in
what
seemed
like
a
beautiful
new
era
—
signaling
a
revival
of
the
artful
capitalg
guitar
rock
long
missing
in
the
mainstream
since
the
bends
eight
years
later
it’s
unclear
whether
bloc
party
is
even
a
band
at
all
just
this
past
month
—
not
even
a
full
year
since
the
release
of
their
most
recent
album
four
—
lissack
dropped
a
surprising
bombshell
to
the
national
post
noting
the
band
will
enter
an
“indefinite
hiatus”
after
the
completion
of
their
summer
tour
“my
wife
came
on
tour
for
two
days
and
said
’your
life
i
can’t
handle
it
it’s
such
a
roller
coaster
of
extreme
highs
and
extreme
lows’”
lissack
said
“that’s
quite
representative
of
all
the
relationships
in
the
band
maybe
we’ll
play
an
amazing
show
and
we’ll
be
on
a
real
high
and
then
the
next
day
some
minor
thing
will
happen
and
everyone
hates
each
other”
but
bloc
party
have
never
exactly
been
built
for
the
long
haul
anyway
this
isn’t
their
first
flirtation
with
a
breakup
four
was
recorded
after
a
brief
hiatus
during
which
time
okereke
explored
a
solo
career
and
the
band
enjoyed
in
a
slew
of
tabloidbait
drama
(in
september
of
2011
the
frontman
told
nme
“i
hope
i
haven’t
been
fired
from
the
band”
after
spotting
the
other
three
enroute
to
a
mysterious
rehearsal
they
later
swept
the
incident
under
the
rug
claiming
it
was
a
joke)
ever
since
silent
alarm’s
solitary
moment
of
brilliance
the
band
has
struggled
to
redefine
itself
with
each
album
—
adding
lush
layers
of
sampling
and
strings
to
2007′s
a
weekend
in
the
city
embracing
an
expansive
electronicheavy
palette
with
2008′s
intimacy
and
peeling
back
with
a
gritty
detuned
menace
on
four
not
all
of
the
sonic
shifts
have
worked
but
even
their
most
awkward
moments
(for
example
the
protool’ed
patchwork
that
is
“hunting
for
witches”)
are
anthemic
in
their
own
dorky
way
this
is
a
band
filled
with
intensely
colorful
personalities
tong
is
one
of
the
most
visceral
drummers
in
all
of
rock
okereke
is
both
newwave
dreamboat
and
spawnofrotten
britpunk
prince
it’s
possible
bloc
party
isn’t
big
enough
to
contain
bloc
party
who
knows
whether
or
not
this
split
will
prove
permanent?
if
there’s
one
thing
we’ve
learned
being
bloc
party
fans
it’s
to
disregard
logic
(hell
just
after
announcing
the
hiatus
lissack
dropped
the
news
of
the
band’s
upcoming
ep
nextwave
sessions)
and
even
though
this
is
a
catalogue
filled
with
inconsistencies
bloc
party
have
still
managed
some
seriously
transcendent
shit
in
their
chaotic
eightyear
lifespan
these
are
bloc
party’s
10
best
songs
as
i
see
them
if
i
left
off
your
favorite
feel
free
to
ring
the
silent
alarm
in
the
comments
section
10
“selfish
son”
(bonus
track
from
napster
and
rhapsody
versions
of
a
weekend
in
the
city
2007)
a
weekend
in
the
city
is
bloc
party’s
patchiest
lp
a
mix
of
illfitting
new
textures
(the
sampledriven
“hunting
for
witches”)
and
rehashed
choruses
from
silent
alarm
but
“selfish
son”
closes
out
the
album
with
a
rare
moment
of
brilliance
—
a
lighterwaiver
ballad
laced
with
a
lasershow
dualguitar
solo
tong’s
trademark
percussive
splatter
and
loads
of
twinkling
glockenspiel
“i
can
be
cruel
to
you”
okereke
croons
in
an
endless
mantra
as
the
catharsis
swirls
toward
infinity
9
“real
talk”&nbsp(from
four&nbsp2012)
as
they
demonstrated
on
the
electronicheavy
intimacy
bloc
party
ain’t
scared
of
overdubs
but
as
“real
talk”
proves
they
don’t
really
need
’em
this
four
standout
is
almost
unnervingly
simple
okereke
patiently
unveiling
lovelorn
confessions
over
a
raw
guitar
chug
tong’s
reserved
pulse
and
what
sounds
like
the
distant
plucking
of
a
banjo
“i’ve
lived
in
every
town
but
here
is
where
i
find
home”
okereke
sings
skyrocketing
to
his
falsetto
“my
mind
is
open
and
my
body
is
yours”
it’s
a
sexy
hypnotic
simmer
that
never
boils
over
8
“talons”&nbsp(from
intimacy&nbsp2008)
with
intimacy
bloc
party
were
coloring
outside
the
lines
of
modern
altguitarrock
beefing
up
their
tunes
with
robust
orchestrations
and
programmed
beats
the
results
were
often
overstuffed
and
claustrophobic
—
but
“talons”
was
an
exception
blending
the
band’s
trademark
rock
bombast
with
a
slinky
electronic
style
eerie
asian
synths
rub
elbows
with
crushing
static
and
distortion
okereke
howling
in
the
eye
of
the
storm
intimacy
often
felt
labored
in
its
quest
for
the
unknown
but
“talons”
was
effortless
in
its
sprawl
7
“signs”
(from
intimacy
2008)
the
critical
punchline
on
intimacy
is
that
it’s
not
too
intimate
but
at
the
center
of
this
expansive
lp
is&nbsp
“signs”
arguably
the
band’s
most
intimate
track
to
date
okereke
is
at
his
most
romantic
here
mourning
a
dying
love
through
vivid
imagery
“two
ravens
in
the
old
oak
tree/
one
for
your
and
one
for
me”
he
sings
over
glistening
music
boxes
and
haunted
synth
washes
“the
last
time
that
we
slept
together
there
was
something
that
was
not
there”
the
final
two
minutes
are
carried
home
by&nbsp
cinematic
strings
as
okereke
clings
desperately
to
sanity
“i
see
signs
all
the
time
that
you’re
not
dead
you’re
sleeping”
6
“day
four”
(from
four&nbsp2012)
when
bloc
party
drop
their
guard
(and
their
distortion)
they’re
experts
at
newwavey
makeout
ballads
lissack
has
a
gift
for
swooning
guitar
atmospheres
and
okereke
possesses
one
of
rock’s
most
emotive
croons
when
the
mood
strikes
him
with
the
exception
of
maybe
“blue
light”
“day
four”
is
the
dreamiest
track
the
band’s
ever
written
okereke’s
angelic
falsetto
on
this
track
makes
chris
martin
sound
like
a
bushleague
chump
“if
you’re
ever
lonely
stay
that
way”
he
flutters
in
a
punchdrunk
stupor
“the
city’s
here
for
you”
5
“valis”
(from
four&nbsp2012)
“valis”
may
be
named
after
an
ominous
scifi
novel
but
it’s
probably
the
most
lighthearted
track
in
the
band’s
entire
catalog
over
pingponging
guitars
and
a
taut
discopunk
groove
okereke
explores
his
silkiest
falsetto
enroute
to
a
chorus
hook
(“you
gotta
show
me
the
waaaaay!”)
that
ranks
among
their
stickiest
rarely
—
if
ever
—
have
bloc
party
sounded
like
they’re
having
so
much
fun
4
“blue
light”
(from&nbspsilent
alarm&nbsp2005)
“i
still
feel
you
and
the
taste
of
cigarettes/
what
could
i
ever
run
to”
okereke
sings
in
fragile
harmony
his
voices
engulfed
by
wilting
guitar
delay
“just
tell
me
it’s
tearing
you
apart/
just
tell
me
you
cannot
sleep”
“blue
light”
is
so
heartbreakingly
awesome
okereke
basically
recycled
it
notefornote
two
years
later
with
“waiting
for
the
718”
bloc
party
may
have
written
more
inventive
songs
but
they
never
wrote
a
more
powerful
one
3
“like
eating
glass”
(from&nbspsilent
alarm&nbsp2005)
bloc
party
have
never
been
heavier
or
more
aggressive
than
on
“like
eating
glass”
the
brilliant
skullcrushing
opener
from
silent
alarm
what’s
most
fascinating
about
this
song
is
its
elaborate
construction
it
opens
with
an
extended
drone
okereke
moaning
over
violent
guitar
chords
and
tong’s
spastic
bulldozer
drums
the
instruments
seem
to
almost
operate
independently
of
each
other
(“we’ve
got
crosses
on
our
eyes”
okereke
sings
at
one
point
“been
walking
into
the
furniture”
that’s
a
fairly
apt
description)
then
moakes’
funky
bassline
enters
the
mix
at
129
suddenly
gluing
together
the
pieces
before
the
chorus’
straightahead
anthemic
chug
“like
eating
glass”
is
a
sonic
jigsaw
puzzle
—
but
its
complexity
is
hugely
cathartic
2
“banquet”&nbsp(from&nbspsilent
alarm&nbsp2005)
“turning
away
from
the
light”
okereke
emotes
on
the
chorus
his
yelps
swarmed
by
jittery
discopunk
tics
“becoming
adult
turning
into
myself”
and
that’s
exactly
what
“banquet”
is
—
the
hormonal
exasperated
sound
of
boys
becoming
men
above
all
though
it’s
just
incredibly
fucking
catchy
okereke
never
wrote
a
more
memorable
chorus
and
the
band’s
intricate
interlocking
groove
(those
crisscrossing
guitars
moakes’
beefy
bass
runs
tong’s
hyperactive
hihat)
is
flawless
in
execution
1
“helicopter”&nbsp(from&nbspsilent
alarm&nbsp2005)
has
a
song
ever
been
so
fittingly
titled?
“helicopter”
is
a
blaring
turbulent
behemoth
built
on
tong’s
machinegun
percussion
and
trebly
guitar
shards
that
stab
like
propellers
and
while
okereke’s
politically
charged
lyrics
occasionally
border
on
the
heavyhanded
(“why
can’t
you
be
more
european?”
he
asks
of
thenpresident
bush
“just
like
his
dad
same
mistakes”)
his
manic
melodic
delivery
adds
urgency
to
the
message
“helicopter”
remains
the
definitive
bloc
party
anthem

burial’s
remix
of
“where

is
probably
superior
to
pretty
much
all
bp
material
after

so

i’m
a
bit
annoyed
by
the
overpresence
of
songs
from
four
but
the
picks
from
intimacy
(an
underrated
album)
are
great
what
about
“i
still
remember”
and
silent
alarm
highlights
like
“so
here
we
are”
“she’s
hearing
voices”
“plans”?

silent
alarm
was
my
favourite
album
of
2005
and
for
a
year
or
two
after
i
searched
relentlessly
for
any
material
i
could
find
(which
reminds
me
i’d
have
been
happy
to
see
‘the
present’
and
‘tulips’)
i
really
wanted
to
like
a
weekend
in
the
city
but
i
just
couldn’t
maybe
because
of
how
much
i
liked
their
sound
on
that
album
and
some
of
the
earlier
stuff
but
really
i
think
it’s
because
most
of
the
stuff
they
did
afterwards
was/is
just
boring
by
comparison

absolutely
changed

so
needless

i’m

by

watered
down

but
if
i
recall
correctly
all
their
upto2009
shit
was
pretty
good
if
semi
faceless
i
went
to
see
them
in
2009
and
tried
to
catch
up
on
their
catalog
beforehand
sucks
they
never
recaptured
the
energy
of
the
debut
cus
i
still
throw
robot
le
garage
and
a&gtb
onto
the
mp3
player
rotation
i
remember
when
that
album
came
out
a
critic
claimed
seemingly
correctly
that
their
first
album
contained
the
only
authentic
punk
to
come
out
in
years
how
was
the
show
you
ask?
i
wouldn’t
know
i
spent
its
entire
duration
on
a
bus
to
a
remote
suburb/neighborhood
of
london
that
took
about
4x
the
amount
of
time
i
thought
it
did
then
when
i
got
off
i
began
walking
up
and
down
what
was
probably
the
same
street
trying
to
find
the
venue
and
asking
confused
firstdaters
where
the
hell
it
was
all
the
while
i
could
hear
trails
of
music
notes
somewhere
nearby
kept
looking
never
found
it
and
the
music
eventually
totally
cut
out
i’m
glad
i
spent
those
4
or
5
hours
thusly
at
least
so
i
could
write
this
i
went
i
just
wasn’t
really
there
you
know?
…this
may
seem
like
a
useless/obnoxious
comment
(like
many
others
i’ve
posted
lately)
but
it
will
be
fun
for

to

this

has
way
too
much
four
on
it
for
my
taste
i
hate
to
say
it
becausei
love
bloc
party
and
have
since
the
beginning
but
that
record
is
just
a
mess
the
only
song
from
it
that
belongs
in
any
top
ten
list
is
“valis”
from
intimacy
i
would
only
take
“signs”
so
well
done
there
but
also
maybe
“ion

that
song
is
just
a
fantastic
closer
i
guess
a
weekend
in
the
city
is
just
going
to
stay
underrated
forever
that
record
is
much
better
than
people
give
it
credit
for
and
songs
like
“waiting
for
the
718”
“the
prayer”
“flux”
“on”
and
“kreuzberg”
for
sure
need
to
be
involved
in
ay
discussion
of
bloc
party’s
best
i’m
sure
it’s
hard
to
make
this

without

most
of
silent
alarm
but
leaving
off
“this
modern

“so

also
think
“little

deserves
a
nod

how
about
“always
new
depths”?

was

a
bside

actually
did

maybe
they
could
have
just
made
silent
alarm
its
own
number?
a
weekend
in
the
city
had
the
difficult
task
of
coming
after
a
masterpiece
but
that
album
goes
also
i
didn’t

on

what
turned
out
to
be
lyrics
from
“this

intimacy
is
my
favourite
album
of
theirs
although
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
i
blasted
it
in
my
rented
toyota
while
barrelling
around
new
zealand
for
two
months
