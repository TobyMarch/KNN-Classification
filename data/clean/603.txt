digable

1994

when
the
seattlebased
label
light
in
the
attic
records
told
ishmael
butler
that
they
wanted
to
put
out
a
vinyl
reissue
of
1994's
blowout
comb
–
the
second
and
final
album
he
recorded
with
the
jazzy
hiphop
trio
digable
planets
–
he
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
flattered
says
the
mc
who
used
to
go
by
butterfly
but
is
better
known
today
as
palaceer
lazaro
the
enigmatic
leader
of
seattle's
shabazz
palaces
that
album
is
like
a
time
capsule
–
it's
an
artifact
from
an
epoch
of
time
you
know
what
i'm
saying?
blowout
comb
emerged
from
the
heady
months
after
digable
planets'
1993
debut
reachin'
(a
new
refutation
of
time
and
space)
spun
off
a
hit
single
with
rebirth
of
slick
(cool
like
dat)
butler
remembers
soaking
up
all
kinds
of
sounds
in
those
days
miles
davis
mobb
deep
parliamentfunkadelic
chicago
house
suddenly
the
limit
looked
a
lot
like
the
sky
after
the
first
album
he
says
we
wanted
to



i
don't
know
how
to
really
say
it
but
to
expand
musically
you
know?
the
trio
–
butler
craig
doodlebug
irving
and
mary
ann
ladybug
mecca
vieira
–
began
by
booking
two
months
at
a
recording
studio
in
downtown
manhattan
taking
full
advantage
of
the
bigger
budget
afforded
by
their
first
album's
success
we
recorded
on
a
daily
schedule
says
butler
we
would
get
to
the
studio
at
like
noon
and
stay
there
until
one
two
in
the
morning
and
just
do
as
much
as
we
could
the
50
greatest
hiphop
songs
of
all
time
in
1994
–
the
year
of
illmatic
and
ready
to
die
among
others
–
new
york
felt
even
more
like
the
center
of
the
universe
than
usual
that
was
the
place
to
be
man
for
me
says
butler
who
had
moved
east
in
the
eighties
after
growing
up
in
seattle
hiphop
is
more
spread
out
now
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
but
back
then
it
was
a
very
new
yorkcentric
genre
being
there
was
exciting
while
digable
planets
perfected
their
luminous
psychedelic
grooves
they
often
ran
into
respected
peers
like
mary
j
blige
nas
and
az
in
the
studio
you
understood
that
you
had
to
really
put
your
best
foot
forward
because
supertalented
and
creative
and
inventive
people
were
out
there
performing
and
executing
music
at
a
superhigh
level
butler
recalls
i
didn't
think
of
it
as
a
competition
–
but
in
order
to
be
throwing
your
lot
in
with
them
you
better
come
with
some
shit
you
know?
critics
and
fans
hailed
blowout
comb
when
it
arrived
in
october
1994
but
radio
didn't
quite
know
what
to
do
with
it
the
album
just
really
wasn't
selling
he
says
but
it
wasn't
really
that
discouraging
to
me
because
we
were
still
touring
–
and
we
didn't
really
give
a
shit
about
the
pop
world
like
that
anyway
the
album
itself
we
were
always
happy
with
digable
planets
broke
up
in
1995
for
reasons
that
butler
says
he
still
isn't
quite
sure
of
they've
reunited
here
and
there
over
the
years
but
further
activity
seems
unlikely
i
talk
to
doodlebug
all
the
time
but
we
don't
talk
to
ladybug
really
because
she
doesn't
really
want
to
talk
to
us
he
says
so
i
don't
know
but
he's
proud
of
what
the
group
accomplished
in
its
brief
lifespan
the
two
albums
that
we
made
–
some
people
look
at
it
like
it
was
an
abbreviated
situation
but
i
don't
he
says
i
feel
like
that's
what
happened
and
it
was
supposed
to
happen
that
way
to
think
that
more
should
have
happened
i
understand
it
i
wished
it
we
all
probably
wished
it
but
we
had
a
nice
run
and
we
made
some
music
anyway
butler
has
plenty
to
occupy
him
in
the
here
and
now
he
just
got
off
tour
with
shabazz
palaces
and
he's
deep
in
sessions
for
the
followup
to
their
2011
debut
black
up
we
built
our
own
studio
in
an
old
brewery
here
in
seattle
that's
been
renovated
he
says
that's
been
the
driving
force
around
the
way
this
shit
sounds
now
–
the
new
sound
true
to
form
he
prefers
to
leave
all
other
specifics
on
the
new
material
unsaid
shabazz
palaces
is
a
realization
of
the
power
and
the
originality
that
lies
in
instinct
says
butler
so
adhering
to
that
philosophically
for
the
music
is
the
way
that
we've
been
going
if
it
has
some
strangeness
to
it
it's
because
it's
an
authentic
strangeness
–&nbspwe're
only
trying
to
do
what's
coming
out
of
us
rather
than
trying
to
fit
into
what
we
see
or
hear
or
some
market
or
genre
we
never
try
to
predict
the
outcome
