her
latest
singles
have
all
underperformed
so
she's
probably
holding
the
release
of
the
album
to
avoid
the
flop
i
think
it
won't
sell
as
much
as
her
previous
albums
including
fireflies
but
it
could
reach
gold
i
think
the
delay
is
disrespectful
to
the
fans
though

the
fuck
is
taking
her
so
long?
i
mean
before
we
could
say
she
was
waiting
for
a
hit
single
(although
didn't
her
popularity
drop
after
the
whole
carrie
underwood
thing?)
but
she
hasn't
released
anything
in
months
now
hearing
something
would
