tom
is
buried
in
the
studio
lovingly
coaxing
his
legacy
analogue
equipment
to
bear
with
him
just
a
little
longer
while
he
wraps
up
the
mix
of
his
latest
song
someday
although
he
has
listened
to
it
more
times
than
he
cares
to
count
he
is
still
very
excited
about
it
saying
this
final
song
might
be
the
title
track
for
the
new
boston
studio
album
it
reminds
me
of
the
up
tempo
rockers
i
wrote
for
the
debut
album
over
30
years
ago
with
a
little
more
tweaking
then
some
retweaking
then
a
tad
more
tweaking
tom
says
the
new
album
should
be
ready
for
release
by
mid
year

that
would
be
mid
year
2013
after
completing
this
mix
i
only
need
to
redo
vocals
on
a
couple
of
the
cuts
remix
them
and
sequence
and
master
the
album
after
working
on
this
project
for
over
10
years
i
can
finally
see
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
he
says
tom
plans
to
start
work
on
the
long
awaited
boston
live
dvd
as
soon
as
the
studio
album
is
finished
meanwhile
in
other
cool
news
gibson
is
honoring
tom
and
his
original
les
paul
with
a
limited
edition
gibson
custom
collectors
choice
guitar
(his
is
#10)
from
gibson
if
you�ve
ever
listened
to
the
music
of
the
legendary
rock
band
boston
then
you�ve
already
heard
the
latest
collector�s
choice
les
paul
in
its
own
right
this
example
of
a
1968
goldtop
(now
with
the
top
stripped
off
the
original
finish
to
expose
its
maple
top)
is
an
amazing
instrument
a
nice
�cheeky�
neck
a
flexible
tone
palate
via
tom�s
preferred
p90
and
dimarzio
super
distortion
pickup
combination
and
a
patina
that
comes
from
a
lifetime
of
extensive
live
and
studio
use
one
of
two
in
tom
scholz�s
collection
this
particular
�68
les
paul
goldtop
deluxe
is
the
first
'real'
guitar
tom
ever
owned
acquired
over
30
years
ago
and
essential
to
his
very
unique
sound
and
career
tom
loves
the
attention
to
detail
that
was
apparent
in
duplicating
his
guitar
he
says
the
precision
with
which
gibson
has
replicated
the
physical
properties
of
my
original
les
paul
is
astounding
this
guitar
feels
and
plays
exactly
like
my
guitar
and
the
resemblance
to
the
original
is
uncanny
but
most
impressive
is
that
it
actually
sounds
like
my
guitar!
i'm
really
humbled
that
such
an
elite
shop
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
reproduce
the
guitar
i
play
tom
says
he
will
donate
all
the
proceeds
from
his
royalties
on
the
sales
to

grown
up
listening

it's
a
real
honor
that
someone
is
looking
up
to
us
as
a
musical
influence
tom
was
very
humbled
by
the
award
and
said

i
don't
really

the
stage

the
award
they
stood
in
front
of
the
drum

the
riser
was
so
large

it
that
drummers

2012
boston
summer
shows
what
the
critics
are
saying
boston
still
has
what
it
takes
to
rock
and
best
of
all
it
didn't
sound
overly
familiar
it
didn't
sound
tired
it
didn't
sound
done
rather
songs
as
recognizable
as
peace
of
mind
and
more
than
a
feeling
seemed
fresh
energized
and
even
surprising

on
milwaukee
the
main
event
boston
lived
up
to
their
top
of
the
bill
standing
they
once
again
proved
why
they
are
the
most
underrated
live
act
that
i
have
seen
studio
recordings
of
boston
music
are
great
enough
in
their
own
right
but
seeing
them
in
a
live
setting
really
makes
one
appreciate
what
they
are
witnessing
the
sheer
musicianship
that
comes
together
during
their
many
extended
instrumental
pieces
should
make
any
real
music
fan
bow
in
wayne's
world
fashion
saying
we're
not
worthy!
we're
not
worthy!

boston
at
its
best
all
the
favorites
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
recordings
mr
scholz
is
a
master
musician/composer/arranger/technician
he
has
managed
to
collect
a
group
of
musicians
(some
from
the
old
days
some
from
the
not
so
old
days)
who
recreated
his
musical
vision
incredibly
well
it
is
one
thing
to
make
music
like
that
in
the
studio
with
all
the
benefits
of
digital
recording
it
is
another
to
see
and
hear
it
reproduced
live
as
a
musician
myself
i
was
astounded
to
see
the
performance
of
so
many
pieces
so
well
executed
as
a
fan
i
had
a
ball
listening
to
those
old
classic
songs

ticketmaster

boston
was
awesome!!!
this
band
knows
how
to
put
on
a
show
the
addition
of
david

did

justice
tommy

tribute

ticketmaster

baseball
caps
off
to
tommy
decarlo
the
current
lead
singer
for
the
band
for
filling
the
big
cleats
of
bradley
delp
who
unfortunately
took
his
own
life
in
2007
having
never
seen
the
band
live
i
was
skeptical
at
what
the
vocals
would
sound
like
delp
had
a
unique
voice
and
style
that
contributed
to
the
bands
iconic
sound
decarlo
hit
it
out
of
the
park
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
hit
every
note
and
captured
the
spirit
of
delp
on
each
song

there
are
very
few
bands
out
there
whose
music
actually
defines
a
genre
but
it's
safe
to
say
when
you
think
of
boston
the
term
'classic
rock'
is
first
and
foremost
and
it's
classic
not
in
the
sense
of
it
being
old
outdated
or
unfashionable
but
classic
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
pop
culture
the
music
industry
itself
and
on
the
timeless
quality
of
the
songs
themselves
very
few
bands
made
the
impact
that
boston
(the
band
prefers
its
name
all
in
capital
letters
to
differentiate
it
from
the
city
from
which
it
hails)
did
when
it
released
it's
debut
selftitled
album
in
1976
rather
than
having
just
one
hit
single
that
album
spawned
a
series
of
hits
that
continue
to
be
staples
of
rock
radio
airplay
from
the
epic
more
than
a
feeling
to
smokin'
long
time
rock
and
roll
band
and
hitch
a
ride
boston
redefined
rock
music
from
a
technical
and
musical
standpoint
to
date
it
has
sold
17
million
copies
in
the
us
alone
there
probably
would
have
been
no
foreigner
journey
or
other
big
arena
rock
bands
of
that
ilk
if
not
for
the
ground
that
was
broken
by
boston
mastermind
tom
scholz
the
band's
guitarist
primary
songwriter
and
producer
when
that
album
came
out
it
was
so
unique
the
sound
of
the
guitars
and
the
sound
of
the
recording
was
so
special
i
remember
driving
my
car
in
my
hometown
of
petaluna
california
and
i
pulled
up
to
a
stoplight
and
was
waiting
for
it
to
change
and
more
than
a
feeling
came
on
the
radio
and
i
was
so
into
it
and
the
guy
in
the
car
in
front
of
me
he
happened
to
be
someone
that
i
knew
he
jumped
out
of
his
car
ran
back
to
my
car
and
said
'are
you
listening
to
that
station
and
hearing
this
band
it's
awesome!'
said
guitarist
gary
pihl
who
after
scholz
is
the
longesttenured
member
of
boston
having
been
in
the
band
since
1985
after
leaving
sammy
hagar's
touring
band
when
the
red
rocker
joined
van
halen
everybody
just
flipped
out
because
it
was
so
unique
how
did
they
get
that
sound?
and
then
there
was
the
content
itself
everyone
could
sing
along
everyone
could
relate
to
the
stories
in
the
lyrics
then
the
band
toured
and
they
were
terrific
live
i
think
all
of
those
things
combine
to
keep
the
music
and
the
band
so
interesting
even
today
people
come
to
the
shows
and
ask
'how
do
you
get
that
sound?'
the
sound
he
speaks
of
is
a
combination
of
what
would
be
called
layered
guitars
a
sound
that
has
become
one
of
boston
and
tom
scholz'
signatures
queen's
brian
may
has
a
similar
sound
but
much
of
the
early
queen
material
was
recorded
through
multiple
amplifiers
with
multiple
guitar
tracks
scholz
an
electronics
whiz
developed
a
device
that
he
later
called
the
rockman
which
creates
the
same
sound
as
multiple
amps
and
tracks

but
is
smaller
than
a
shoebox
eventually
scholz
built
a
little
mini
music
tech
empire
[which
he
sold
a
few
years
ago]
around
the
rockman
and
his
other
inventions
many
of
which
made
it
possible
for
bands
and
musicians
to
record
at
home
rather
than
spending
huge
amounts
of
money
on
studio
sessions
in
my
mind
he
started
the
recordathome
revolution
because
he
recorded
that
first
boston
album
at
home
in
his
basement
and
once
that
news
came
out
every
other
musician
said
'you
mean
i
don't
have
to
spend
$125
an
hour
to
record
an
album?'
so
he
was
the
first
to
record
a
hit
album
at
home
all
the
recording
equipment
manufacturers
picked
up
on
that
and
said
'wow
we
can
sell
to
all
musicians
as
opposed
to
just
selling
our
products
to
recording
studios
said
pihl
who
was
hired
by
scholz
to
demonstrate
his
gadgets
at
industry
trade
shows
and
eventually
became
an
employee
of
not
only
scholz
but
a
member
of
his
band
we
have
had
many
musicians
tell
us
how
much
they
used
the
equipment
we
used
to
tell
people
it
was
like
an
a
to
z
of
the
industry
from
alabama
to
zz
top
used
to
call
us
to
say
they
were
using
the
rockman
on
their
new
record
def
leppard
sent
us
a
gold
record
because
of
how
much
they
liked
the
technology
joe
satriani
joe
walsh
jeff
beck
the
list
just
goes
on
and
on
for
people
who
have
used
that
little
device
that
tom
invented
to
help
him
record
at
home
boston's
first
album
was
six
years
in
the
making
but
as
with
any
hit
band
the
pressure
from
the
music
industry
to
produce
a
followup
was
big
don't
look
back
came
out
two
years
later
in
1978
which
doesn't
seem
like
a
long
space
of
time
but
in
the
1970s
when
bands
like
kiss
put
out
two
albums
a
year
it
was
an
eternity
legal
hassles
prevented
the
third
album
from
coming
out
until
1986
but
fans
were
patient
and
third
stage
which
was
pihl's
first
recorded
work
with
boston
became
a
radio
hit
on
the
strength
of
hits
like
we're
ready
amanda
and
cool
the
engines
a
fourth
album
walk
on
didn't
come
out
until
1994
while
corporate
america
the
band's
last
album
came
out
in
2002
the
band's
touring
schedule
has
also
been
infrequent
with
boston
last
hitting
the
road
in
2008
which
is
also
the
last
time
the
band
came
to
canada
on
the
summer
2012
tour
the
band
will
be
coming
to
belleville
as
part
of
the
empire
rockfest
series
playing
friday
july
27
the
night
after
playing
at
casino
rama
near
barrie
in
general
we
like
to
tour
when
we
have
a
new
album
or
greatest
hits
package
or
something
and
new
albums
are
kind
of
few
and
far
between
we
hope
that
with
our
tours
it's
a
question
of
quality
rather
than
quantity
we're
always
working
on
new
songs
but
we're
not
quick
in
the
studio
said
pihl
confirming
media
reports
that
there
is
indeed
a
new
boston
album
in
the
work
tom
has
been
on
record
as
saying
that
it's
about
85
per
cent
complete
we
were
hoping
to
have
it
out
this
year
but
it
wasn't
quite
ready
but
because
we
thought
it
might
be
out
tom
said
we
should
do
some
touring
it's
been
a
while
it's
been
four
years
and
he
said
it
didn't
matter
that
the
record
wasn't
out
he
said
'let's
go
out
anyways'
and
i
said
'great!'
pihl
said
there
won't
be
any
new
material
in
the
set
but
that
some
older
boston
musical
chestnuts
might
make
an
appearance
after
many
years
there
is
also
scuttlebutt
within
the
music
industry
that
some
vocal
tracks
from
brad
delp
the
band's
longtime
vocalist
may
make
an
appearance
on
the
new
album
tommy
decarlo
was
with
us
on
the
last
tour
and
as
some
people
may
know
we
found
him
on
myspace
somebody
called
us
and
told
us
about
this
guy
doing
boston
songs
on
myspace

so
we
checked
it
out
we
loved
it
and
called
him
up
pihl
explained
and
he
had
never
been
in
a
band
in
his
life
he
just
recorded
the
songs
on
his
own
at
home
and
posted
them
but
he
has
a
great
voice
and
was
a
heck
of
a
nice
guy
and
we
asked
him
to
come
on
tour
so
he's
back
and
better
than
ever
the
rest
of
the
boston
touring
lineup
includes
vocalist
david
victor
bassist
tracy
ferrie
and
drummer
curly
smith
making
a
return
to
the
drummer's
stool
after
a
number
of
years
delp
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
signature
boston
sound
as
was
scholz's
powerhouse
guitar
licks
and
production
skills
and
his
passing
was
a
tragedy
not
only
for
his
family
and
friends
but
also
for
lovers
of
melodic
rock
and
roll
as
sung
by
a
truly
unique
talent
there
was
nobody
like
brad
he
was
a
wonderful
guy
it
was
sammy
hagar
that
first
said
publicly
that
brad
was
the
nicest
guy
in
rock
and
roll
so
we
certainly
miss
him
said
pihl
brad
really
hit
those
high
notes
and
outside
of
freddie
mercury
that
just
wasn't
done
because
it
wasn't
the
style
besides
working
in
boston
pihl
is
also
part
of
a
band
called
december
people
which
tours
the
us
during
the
holiday
season
we
had
the
idea
of
doing
traditional
holiday
songs
but
in
the
styles
of
other
rock
bands
and
all
the
shows
would
be
benefits
for
the
local
food
banks
so
wherever
we
go
the
food
bank
gets
a
big
donation
and
when
i
was
told
that
i
said
'hey
count
me
in'
he
said
so
we
start
off
playing
and
it
sounds
like
pinball
wizard
by
the
who
but
we
start
singing
joy
to
the
world
and
we
do
santa
claus
is
coming
to
town
like
zz
top
doing
la
grange
and
the
audience
just
loves
it
and
have
such
a
great
time
doing
it
it's
a
great
bunch
of
guys
in
the
band
and
it's
for
worthy
causes
returning
to
the
subject
of
boston's
leader
and
musical
maestro
pihl
said
scholz
may
just
be
one
of
the
most
underrated
figures
in
rock
history
when
they
talk
about
the
100
best
guitarists
of
rock
tom
is
always
there
but
he
is
there
amongst
the
top
keyboard
players
of
all
time
and
how
about
the
top
100
songs
of
all
time?
there's
always
a
couple
of
boston
songs
there
and
he's
considered
to
be
one
of
the
top
producers
and
engineers
of
all
time
so
he
is
a
very
unique
guy
pihl
said
of
his
friend
of
35plus
years
but
he
is
so
down
to
earth
and
a
wonderful
guy
to
work
with

and
very
humble
he
just
really
cares
about
people
and
he
doesn't
really
like
the
limelight
he
isn't
the
guy
with
the
big
ego
that
goes
around
saying
'hey
i
am
a
rock
star
look
at
me'
he'd
rather
just
walk
down
the
street
and
be
a
regular
guy
regular
guy
or
not
scholz
and
his
bandmates
can
still
rock
a
crowd
with
some
of
the
best
rock
riffs
ever
written
and

in
the

in

my
freshman
dorm
at
lafayette
college
listened
to
boston's
first
album
so
much
we
practically
adopted
the
band
we
just
gorged
on
that
supersonic
smorgasbord
of
hammering
guitars
slamming
vocals
and
partyhearty
harmonies
i
had
several
happy
flashbacks
to
those
heady
days
in
mckeen
hall
during
boston's
concert
monday
night
at
riverplace
a
near
sellout
crowd
of
6017
heard
rock
'n'
roll
that
pounded
the
soul
and
rearranged
vital
organs
guitarist
tom
scholz
the
only
survivor
of
the
original
quintet
created
chiming
spooning
buzzsawing
duets
with
guitarist
gary
pihl
second
in
seniority
with
23
years
bassist
kimberley
dahme
and
drummer
jeff
neal
both
relative
babes
in
the
woods
offered
a
potent
onetwo
punch
founding
lead
vocalist
brad
delp
who
committed
suicide
last
year
was
replaced
seamlessly
by
newcomers
michael
sweet
founding
frontman
of
stryper
the
christian
metalsmiths
and
tommy
decarlo
a
home
depot
credit
manager
hired
because
of
his
deft
delplike
performances
of
boston
tunes
on
myspace
decarlo's
tart
ringing
singing
helped
make
feelin'
satisfied
very
satisfying
sweet's
pointy
lusty
voice
powered
peace
of
mind
which
he
recently
covered
with
stryper
he
doubled
as
the
evening's
best
entertainer
bending
over
his
guitar
tossing
his
long
hair
and
twirling
in
a
punk
trance
like
some
ramone
the
highlight
of
the
night
was
an
orgasmic
foreplay/long
time
the
former
featured
an
almost
anarchic
web
of
sonorities
the
latter
featured
sweet's
foaming
voice
pihl's
raving
solo
and
a
levitating
finale
boston's
tom
scholz
still
rockin'
with
two
les
paul
goldtops
tom
scholz's
reputation
as
a
technological
wizard
and
gearhound
is
well
deserved
as
the
boston
guitarist
holds
enough
electronicsrelated
patents
to
wallpaper
his
home
studio
that
being
the
case
you
might
surmise
the
veteran
player
owns
a
commensurate
number
of
electric
guitars
in
fact
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
i
have
only
two
guitars
scholz
says
they're
both
old
les
paul
goldtops
i
bought
them
both
used
at
a
time
when
i
didn't
know
anything
about
les
pauls
somebody
told
me
that
these
two
guitars
were
made
for
only
six
months
during
half
of
1968
so
there
are
only
a
very
few
in
existence
the
neck
on
the
guitar
is
completely
different
from
the
neck
on
every
other
type
of
les
paul
it's
huge
at
first
i
couldn't
play
on
it
at
all
and
then
after
finally
learning
how
to
play
on
it
i
discovered
that
there
weren't
any
others
available
but
the
amazing
thing
is
i
found
two
of
them
without
knowing
that
the
second
one
was
from
1968
as
well
from
that
six
month
period
this
happened
before
the
first
boston
album
was
released
i
needed
a
second
guitar
before
we
went
on
the
road
so
i
snatched
it
up
i
bought
both
guitars
for
about
$300
to
celebrate
the
life
of
boston
lead
singer
brad
delp
whose
suicide
this
past
march
roiled
the
rock
world
scholz
staged
a
fivehour
musical
event
last
month
at
boston's
bank
of
america
pavilion
titled
come
together
a
tribute
to
brad
delp
the
event
saw
past
and
present
boston
personnel
who
historically
have
been
a
contentious
bunch
putting
aside
their
differences
to
pay
homage
to
the
much
loved
singer
inevitably
any
public
appearance
by
scholz
fuels
speculation
about
future
boston
studio
albums
given
the
guitarist's
legendary
perfectionism
it's
doubtful
a
new
release
will
be
forthcoming
any
time
soon
most
of
what
i
record
nobody
ever
hears
scholz
says
at
least
90
percent
of
it
goes
into
a
box
which
now
weighs
a
couple
hundred
pounds
basically
when
i
start
working
on
something
all
i
have
are
ideas
they
just
come
in
a
flood
and
i
try
as
many
of
them
as
i
can
sometimes
they're
very
simple
things
like
whether
to
doubletrack
or
tripletrack
a
part
and
sometimes
it's
more
complicated
things
like
changing
lyrics
or
the
melody
or
deciding
whether
or
not
to
use
vocal
harmonies
each
song
takes
an
awful
lot
of
time
coming
together
at
the
hard
rock
a
gathering
at
the
hard
rock
cafe
prior
to
brad's
tribute
on
august
19
provided
a
great
atmosphere
for
boston
fans
to
reminisce
and
meet
fellow
fans
as
well
as
some
of
the
musicians
the
oldest
and
newest

kimberley

stopped
by
to
join
in
the
festivities
for
a
while
before
heading
off
to
prepare
for
the
show
some
dedicated
fans
took
it
upon
themselves
to
raise
money
for

foundation
in

of
brad

opportunity
to
celebrate

his
affection

and

a
terrific
job
with
the
three
songs
she

i
sent
to
andy
andy
thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
answer
your
questions
by
email
i
haven't
been
in
the
mood
to
talk
to
people
much
for
the
last
few
days
as
you
might
imagine
but
i
appreciate
you
turning
to
me
for
this
brad
and
i
were
friends
and
collaborators
for
35
years
both
of
us
being
vegetarians
nondrug
users
and
more
interested
in
music
than
money
put
us
in
a
very
small
minority
in
the
music
business
our
bond
ran
much
deeper
than
just
boston
music
in
answer
to
your
questions
i
met
brad
soft
spoken
and
unassuming
when
he
auditioned
in
a
recording
studio
outside
of
boston
one
night
to
sing
several
songs
i
had
written
back
then
in
the
early
seventies
recording
a
song
demo
meant
coming
up
with
a
significant
amount
of
money
several
weeks
of
my
day
job
savings
to
buy
a
few
hours
of
8
track
time
having
endured
countless
sessions
with
other
singers
most
with
undeserved
egos
i
had
only
the
faintest
glimmer
of
hope
that
he
might
be
good
enough
to
squeak
by
as
a
suitable
vocalist
he
didn't
warm
up
he
just
listened
to
the
prerecorded
instrument
track
once
then
he
started
to
sing
i
don't
know
if
it
took
two
seconds
or
three
but
before
he
finished
singing
the
first
line
i
knew
that
some
guardian
angel
had
just
delivered
to
me
one
of
the
best
vocalists
ever
to
step
up
to
a
microphone!
then
he
kept
going
and
i
realized
he
wasn't
just
one
of
the
best
he
was
amazing!
high
notes
i
hadn't
heard
before
followed
by
harmonies
and
overdubbed
exact
duplicate
layered
tracks
all
with
ease
all
with
emotion
and
yet
all
technically
precise
before
we
left
that
night
he
had
rewritten
the
lyrics
and
the
melody
sung
all
the
vocal
parts
and
with
the
magic
of
his
voice
turned
my
stark
guitar
riff
into
a
song!
from
that
moment
on
i
only
hoped
i
could
write
and
record
music
worthy
of
his
attention
and
interpretation
there
were
soulful
notes
that
pulled
you
into
the
song
stratospheric
screams
and
angelic
high
notes
and
after
hitting
these
record
breaking
notes
he'd
go
back
and
sing
a
harmony
part
above
it!
he
didn't
rehearse
any
of
these
parts
he
could
jump
back
and
forth
between
harmony
parts
double
tracking
parts
and
then
go
back
and
do
it
again
exactly
the
same
with
one
tiny
change
adjusting
all
the
other
singing
parts
to
fit
with
bionic
accuracy
you'd
think
anyone
with
this
super
human
talent
would
be
an
insufferable
egomaniac
but
brad
was
just
the
opposite
and
amazingly
he
remained
honestly
humble
in
spite
of
the
incredible
star
pressure
that
followed
boston's
success
brad
and
i
banged
our
heads
against
the
wall
trying
to
get
a
break
with
record
companies
for
five
years
during
that
time
he
and
i
did
a
lot
of
basement
recording
we
received
absolutely
zero
recognition
locally
and
complete
rejection
submitting
our
demos
to
national
record
labels
i
think
this
experience
put
our
future
success
in
perspective
as
we
both
realized
that
after
so
many
years
of
insult
we
were
just
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
record
and
play
music
above
ground!
unlike
many
other
individuals
eventually
involved
with
boston
brad's
down
to
earth
personality
never
wavered
it
was
his
natural
demeanor
when
someone
asked
me
what
brad
was
like
the
first
words
that
always
came
to
mind
were
nice
guy
oddly
his
incredible
performing
abilities
seem
barely
worth
mentioning
compared
to
his
attributes
as
a
human
being
he
was
soft
spoken
yet
very
quick
and
funny
although
i
rarely
remember
seeing
him
in
the
throws
of
a
good
belly
laugh
he
could
keep
the
people
around
him
in
stitches
effortlessly
and
did
so
on
a
daily
basis
when
he
wasn't
making
someone
laugh
or
giving
his
time
to
a
fan
he
was
a
tireless
worker
both
in
the
studio
and
on
stage
he
and
i
had
a
very
strong
personal
connection
because
of
our
moral
beliefs
yet
we
were
drastically
different
kinds
of
people
while
i
am
rebellious
and
easily
provoked
to
an
unyielding
defense
brad
was
passive
and
studiously
non
confrontational
somehow
over
the
years
i
think
we
both
grew
not
only
to
accept
this
in
each
other
but
to
respect
it
i
think
this
is
part
of
the
reason
we
were
able
to
work
together
for
so
much
of
our
lives
in
an
odd
parallel
we
were
also
opposites
in
the
studio
once
brad
would
laid
down
a
vocal
track
he
became
instantly
committed
to
it
and
would
dig
in
if
challenged
whereas
i
would
want
to
change
everything
and
never
be
sure
we
were
usually
at
odds
on
how
vocal
arrangements
should
go
also
which
in
early
years
caused
heated
debates
later
we
both
developed
such
respect
for
each
other's
abilities
that
the
collaboration
so
important
to
the
eventual
outcome
of
boston's
music
became
much
easier
it
was
largely
my
music
but
it
was
brad
who
brought
it
to
life
and
this
struggle
we
both
had
to
endure
was
part
of
what
made
it
so
many
people's
favorite
i
last
saw
brad
at
rehearsal
last
month
where
we
prepared
several
old
and
new
songs
for
our
upcoming
summer
shows
these
are
my
fondest
memories
playing
music
with
my
friend
and
the
greatest
singer
in
rock
and
roll
andy
brad
and
i
have
been
used
and
abused
throughout
our
adult
life
by
the
music
business
it
continues
even
in
his
death
please
do
the
right
thing
with
this
sorry

tom

narm

announce
the
definitive
200
after
months
of
speculation
narm
and
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
have
finally
unveiled
the
official
list
of
the
200
albums
and
soundtracks
that
comprise
the
definitive
200
the
beatles'
massively
influential
st
pepper's
lonely

club

tops
the
list
followed
by
dark

led

zepplin
iv
and
u2's
joshua

the
definitive
200
urges
people
to
remember
that
most
of
their
favorite
songs
are
part
of
a
unique
art
form
the
album
said
narm
president
jim
donio
in
an
era
when
record
stores
and
album
sales
are
somewhat
embattled
narm
thought
it
was
the
perfect
time
to
release
this
list
and
have
retailers
promote
these
great
classic
albums
there
are
no
greatest
hits
or
best
of
compilations
we
are
reminding
folks
what
we
already
know
to
be
true
albums
just
like
record
stores
aren't
going
anywhere!
the
list
was
chosen
by
a
committee
of
narm
retailers
their
selections
spanned
the
past
50
years
of
modern
popular
music
a
handful
of
artists
have
multiple
albums
on
the
list
in
compiling
the
list
continues
donio
we
asked
retailers
to
think
about
the
titles
that
fans
keep
coming
back
to
the
titles
that
stand
out
for
them
it's
not
just
about
sales
although
albums
that
have
sold
well
are
obviously
represented
here
it's
really
about
the
passion
that
music
buyers
have
shown
for
these
particular
titles
and
the
albums'
potential
for
enduring
popularity
today
with
new
audiences
from
pop
country
r
and
b
and
hip
hop
albums
just
a
few
years
old
to
rock
blues

by
mike
mettler
november
2006
before
i
had
a
chance
to
listen
to
them
i
read
a
wonderful
telling
statement
in
regard
to
the
reissues
of
boston
and
don't
look
back
remastered
under
tom
scholz's
supervision
it's
true
i
did
them
up
here
in
new
england
with
a
couple
of
trusted
engineer
friends
of
mine
and
we
more
than
supervised
we
took
those
things
apart
piece
by
piece
every
nut
and
bolt
came
out
of
those
songs
we
tweaked
all
of
the
things
that
couldn't
be
done
with
the
mixes
in
the
'70s
i
hadn't
been
able
to
listen
to
either
one
of
those
albums
since
they
were
first
released
on
cd
in
the
'80s
or
whenever
there
were
also
super
bit
mapped
cds
of
both
albums
that
came
out
in
the
'90s
you
know
what?
it
doesn't
really
matter
i
mean
16bit
audio
absolutely
destroys
the
waveform
especially
in
the
high
end
a
lot
of
things
that
i
thought
were
fine
on
vinyl
or
cassette
tape
parts
that
had
a
lot
of
brightness
and
sibilance
in
them
sounded
horrible
on
16bit
cd
i
literally
could
not
listen
to
those
albums
on
cd
all
these
years
i
saw
this
as
a
huge
opportunity
i
dropped
everything
i
shut
down
a
10day
vacation
i
had
just
started
around
my
birthday
[march
10]
and
went
to
work
we
just
literally
went
through
those
things
second
by
second
or
i
should
say
millisecond
by
millisecond
and
did
all
the
things
you
can
do
now
with
automated
eq
and
other
signalprocessing
techniques
since
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
digital
format
anyway
there
was
nothing
to
lose
did
you
have
the
original
masters
yourself?
i
didn't
they
[sony]
had
the
original
quarterinchtape
stereo
masters
and
did
a
very
good
job
of
doing
the
a/d
conversion
i
have
to
tell
you
i
would
have
been
sweating
bullets
doing
that
myself
so
we
had
good
24bit
transfers
to
start
with
i'm
really
excited
about
how
they
came
out
and
i
never
thought
i'd
get
excited
about
something
i
did
30
years
ago
i
can
finally
listen
to
these
mixes
on
cd
now
[laughs]
what
kinds
of
problems
were
apparent
to
you
on
the
original
cds?
first
of
all
expectations
for
the
tone
balance
on
recorded
music
has
changed
considerably
over
the
last
30
years
for
example
the
amount
of
low
end
in
a
bass
instrument
is
a
helluva
lot
higher
in
mixes
today
and
there
were
a
lot
of
problems
in
the
treble
ranges
which
i
attribute
largely
to
the
trouble
with
16bit
audio
in
general
and
maybe
somewhat
to
the
fact
that
vinyl
and
tape
did
a
good
job
of
toning
those
things
down
for
reproduction
back
in
the
old
days
what
i
did
was
correct
everything
that
i
didn't
like
things
that
couldn't
be
done
in
the
original
mix
which
was
all
done
by
hand
and
things
that
couldn't
be
done
in
the
original
mastering
which
of
course
was
done
by
hand
as
well
and
back
in
those
days
was
quite
limited
even
in
a
nice
mastering
room
like
capitol
records
you
had
very
little
opportunity
to
make
adjustments
or
changes
of
course
going
into
a
24bit
modernday
editing
program
you
can
basically
do
whatever
your
knowledge
imagination
and
time
will
allow
and
we
did
have
a
very
severe
time
crunch
since
we
had
gotten
sony
to
stop
going
forth
with
their
own
remaster
that
would
have
been
a
disaster
yeah
it
did
sound
terrible
so
we
got
into
it
and
did
nothing
in
between
working
on
these
mixes
except
sleep
remastering
the
whole
thing
took
8
days
of
1214
hours
a
day
straight
through
i
was
really
happy
with
what
we
got
you
hear
a
lot
of
things
you
didn't
hear
before
and
things
that
used
to
irritate
me
or
sound
screechy
now
sound
full
and
natural
for
example
[singer]
brad
[delp's]
voice
was
warmed
up
the
way
it
should
be
and
you
can
really
feel
that
bass
guitar
instead
of
just
hearing
it
any
other
specific
examples?
we
made
thousands
of
changes
thousands
every
vocal
line
every
guitar
part
the
whole
bottom
end
the
bass
has
been
brought
up
in
the
mix
relative
to
the
bass
in
the
kick
drum
which
gives
a
heckuva
lot
more
punch
from
the
bass
instruments
the
vocals
in
many
of
the
songs
appear
louder
even
though
there's
a
lot
more
bass
the
vocals
appear
louder
than
they
did
before
which
is
usually
something
you
fight
with
when
you
bring
the
bass
up
the
vocals
disappear
and
all
of
the
shrill
guitar
parts
have
been
fixed
the
reason
it's
hard
to
pick
out
specific
instances
is
because
there
literally
isn't
one
second
of
any
song
on
either
of
those
albums
that
wasn't
touched
[laughs]
at
the
outset
of
boston
when
that
first
bassguitar
note
hits
in
more
than
a
feeling
it's
a
lot
fuller
and
a
lot
bigger
and
when
brad
starts
singing
his
voice
is
louder
it's
hard
to
achieve
that
especially
when
those
rhythm
powerchord
guitars
are
playing
at
the
beginnings
of
songs
or
breaks
between
chorus
and
verses
the
guitars
are
much
more
powerful
that
power
was
something
that
slipped
through
the
cracks
when
i
was
making
the
original
master
tracks
it
was
a
mistake
i
knew
about
it
after
the
fact
but
back
then
in
the
'70s
it
couldn't
be
fixed
also
a
lot
of
cymbals
leadguitar
parts
and
some
vocals
got
very
very
screechy
in
the
16bit
product
and
those
have
all
been
brought
back
into
range
they
all
now
sound
pretty
good
to
me
on
cd
and
i
don't
usually
like
the
way
anything
sounds
on
cd
in
general
you've
never
been
a
fan
of
digital
i
work
only
in
an
analog
studio
so
i
hear
music
at
its
very
best
i
mean
there's
nothing
like
the
sound
of
an
analog
multitrack
recording
playing
back
you'll
never
hear
it
sound
so
good
again
because
it
actually
is
the
real
thing
it's
the
real
music
by
the
real
musicians
the
phase
hasn't
been
all
screwed
up
by
the
a/d
conversion
and
the
high
end
isn't
all
messed
up
trying
to
fit
a
16khz
tone
into
three
pieces
of
a
44hz
sampling
rate
in
an
analog
studio
you're
hearing
pristine
realworld
sound
the
way
it
would
sound
if
it
was
coming
through
the
mikes
and
you
were
listening
to
them
in
headphones
right
there
in
your
room
24bit
digital
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
but
as
soon
as
you
make
the
conversion
to
16bit
it
sounds
like
crap
[laughs]
i
have
a
hard
time
listening
to
cds
after
working
on
an
analog
original
because
of
what
they
do
to
the
depth
perception
the
phaseangle
errors
caused
by
the
a/d
conversion
really
bother
me
they
bothered
me
the
very
first
time
i
heard
digital
next
to
an
analog
original
i
was
always
amazed
that
people
didn't
perceive
that
something
that
once
sounded
like
it
was
located
way
beyond
their
speakers
now
sounded
like
it
was
on
a
flat
plane
all
collapsed
basically
yeah
that's
what
digital
does
it
changes
the
audio
waveform
people
think
digital
is
an
accurate
representation
of
music
and
it's
not
and
because
of
the
phaseangle
error
all
the
things
that
your
ear
and
your
brain
do
normally
to
figure
out
where
sounds
are
coming
from
to
form
a
mental
aural
map
if
you
will
of
your
audio
surroundings
it
takes
that
and
completely
fools
it
it
turns
something
that
had
enormous
depth
and
was
recorded
in
a
natural
beautiful
hall
and
puts
it
into
a
little
flat
thing
in
front
of
you
so
as
you
can
see
i've
hated
digital
from
the
beginning
but
it's
cheap
and
it's
got
a
lot
of
features
and
that's
what
sells
if
audiophiles
had
our
way
we'd
just
go
back
to
reeltoreel
tape
i
wish!
there
was
nothing
as
good
and
nothing
ever
will
be
probably
but
in
the
meantime
i
think
we
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
making
the
adjustments
so
that
those
early
albums
come
across
really
well
on
cd
and
in
some
ways
because
of
the
improvements
we
made
in
the
mastering
i
prefer
the
new
cd
version
over
the
original
vinyl
what
compromises
did
you
have
to
make
when
you
originally
mastered
the
album
to
vinyl?
the
compromises
in
those
days
were
huge
every
song
was
basically
well
this
is
the
best
we
can
get
with
what
we've
got
even
though
those
mixes
were
done
at
what
was
considered
a
wellequipped
mixing
room
[westlake
audio
in
los
angeles]
there
was
only
so
much
you
could
do
we
were
doing
it
manually
the
outboard
gear
available
for
signal
processing
was
really
crude
by
today's
standards
so
we
did
the
best
we
could
but
i
knew
what
i
would
have
done
if
we
hadn't
had
all
those
limitations
and
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
do
it
it
was
a
little
more
difficult
working
with
the
2track
as
opposed
to
being
able
to
take
the
multitrack
and
remix
it
but
i
think
we
made
enormous
improvements
the
tracks
have
a
lot
more
power
that
was
the
thing
i
was
looking
for
these
two
albums
are
all
about
power
i
remember
in
the
days
of
vinyl
we
just
used
to
turn
them
up
as
loud
as
we
could
go
sure
a
little
speaker
distortion
always
helped
[both
laugh]
well
the
differences
in
the
new
masters
aren't
subtle
at
all
when
you
put
on
album
one
[boston]
right
away
you'll
hear
a
difference
in
the
listenability
and
the
impact
of
the
power
chords
and
the
bass
instruments
it
made
a
world
of
difference
to
me
listening
to
them
and
i
think
we
made
even
more
improvements
with
don't
look
back
the
whole
album
switching
gears
here
what's
your
take
on
digital
files
and
ipods?
don't
get
me
started
on
mp3s
no
please
do
get
started!
this
is
what
we
live
for!
[laughs]
i'll
just
leave
it
at
[pauses]
i
hate
them
people
find
it
hard
to
believe
but
other
than
the
obvious
noisefloor
considerations
cassettes
sounded
much
better
than
any
of
this
digital
crap
for
everyday
use
i
still
use
constant
quickreference
mixes
in
the
studio
different
arrangements
different
guitar
parts
different
singing
parts
different
mix
ideas
so
i
always
have
a
loaded
readytogo
mix
deck
hooked
up
to
my
stereo
bus
at
any
moment
i
can
push
the
button
record
and
sit
back
and
a/b
the
different
parts
and
ideas
if
i
didn't
have
a
cassette
deck
doing
that
job
i'd
be
lost
i
was
so
worried
about
it
that
i
bought
a
second
cassette
deck
and
then
i
bought
boxes
and
boxes
of
the
maxell
tape
that
i
use
since
i
figure
at
some
point
they'll
stop
making
it
i
depend
on
it
so
heavily
there's
nothing
else
that
will
quickly
reproduce
an
accurate
representation
of
sound
to
exacting
standards
like
you
said
reeltoreel
was
the
best
and
i
always
have
to
put
cassette
right
behind
it
the
only
thing
being
the
noisefloor
issue
i
remember
columbia
tapes
back
in
the
day
wearing
out
after
many
repeated
listenings
right
not
only
that
but
i
used
to
get
half
a
dozen
tapes
of
an
album
and
i'd
put
them
on
one
after
another
and
the
differences
in
the
eq
and
the
high
end
between
them
would
be
all
over
the
lot
are
cds
in
danger
of
becoming
extinct?
do
you
think
we're
moving
to
a
purely
digitaldelivery
age?
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
companies
are
going
to
be
able
to
sell
lowquality
audio
product
in
massive
numbers
far
more
easily
than
they
can
sell
a
true
highquality
reproduction
unfortunately
people
have
shown
by
their
dollar
votes
that
they
don't
care
about
quality
nearly
as
much
as
they
do
features
convenience
and
cost
it's
a
little
ironic
because
i
remember
when
i
was
in
school
[in
the
late
'60s]
the
thing
to
do
was
buy
the
parts
or
kits
and
spend
hours
and
hours
building
your
own
amplifiers
and
preamps
and
all
this
stuff
so
that
you
could
get
absolute
primo
best
possible
sound
i
did
it
and
most
of
the
college
kids
i
knew
did
that
they
were
the
first
to
embrace
stereo
broadcast
with
fullfrequency
reproduction
today
college
kids
are
buying
this
lowgrade
cheap
kinda
crappy
audio
sound
it's
bizarre
i'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
happened
to
the
current
generation
music
is
in
the
background
rather
than
the
foreground
growing
up
we
put
aside
everything
to
listen
to
a
new
album
people
don't
really
do
that
anymore
that's
probably
true
i
suppose
convenience
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
too
music
production
is
pretty
bad
for
the
delivery
that's
available
eventually
it
could
be
only
something
really
horrible
like
mp3
but
there
will
be
a
very
small
and
very
expensive
alternative
just
like
there
is
today
you
can
get
audio
on
a
dvd
that's
at
least
in
24bit
and
24bit
digital
audio
is
not
bad
so
i
imagine
there
may
be
a
direct
electronicdelivery
system
that
will
be
at
least
24bit
with
hopefully
a
higher
bit
rate
that
some
people
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
like
those
who
do
for
halfspeed
masters
what
do
you
think
of
surround
sound?
surround
sound
is
nice
but
what
the
hell
do
you
need
five
speakers
for?
they
did
it
with
four
early
on
in
the
'70s
quad
and
it
sounded
awesome
it
was
four
real
channels
that
people
would
mix
to
using
real
reverberation
and
real
instruments
not
some
conjured
up
delayed
fake
thing
to
give
it
false
spatial
effects
it's
fine
and
it
sounds
neat
but
what
do
you
need
five
speakers
for?
i'll
take
that
thought
one
step
further
10
years
after
quad
came
out
people
were
understanding
sound
interpretation
in
the
human
ear
and
mind
well
enough
to
be
able
to
locate
sound
from
a
pair
of
speakers
anywhere
in
a
room
and
some
of
it
was
quite
strikingly
good
for
that
you
had
to
have
very
very
good
analog
reproduction
none
of
this
digital
crap
where
you
change
phase
angles
with
respect
to
frequency
because
as
soon
as
you
do
that
you
destroy
it
it
was
actually
possible
in
the
analog
world
to
have
surround
sound
with
two
speakers
so
i
look
at
it
and
i
think
what
a
scam
for
selling
five
speakers
and
five
channels
of
crap
to
people
for
what
could
have
been
done
with
two
speakers
actually
it's
six
because
you
have
a
separate
sub
channel
of
course
still
it's
a
scam
and
it
sounds
neat
but
it
can
be
done
with
fewer
components
i
don't
want
to
sound
overly
cynical
as
it's
one
of
those
things
you
can
have
fun
with
but
it's
not
an
eloquent
solution
for
doing
the
job

the

redone
(not

and
the

is
completely
different
(tom

the

sucked

the

cameron

in
1976
a
garage
band
called
boston
released
their
debut
album
selftitled
boston
in
what
is
now
classic
rock
history
it
took
the
charts
and
the
world
by
storm
going
to
number
one
and
becoming
the
best
selling
album
of
all
time
a
title
which
was
held
for
many
years
two
years
later
and
having
already
catapulted
into
the
classic
rock
pantheon
boston
released
their
followup
album
don't
look
back
the
album
was
rushrecorded
at
the
studio's
insistence
a
far
cry
from
the
sevenyear
long
ordeal
that
was
boston
which
explains
the
albums
short
33minute
running
time
both
boston
albums
have
now
been
remastered
for
the
first
time
each
by
head
band
member
tom
scholz
boston
the
classic
cd
consistently
ranked
one
of
the
best
classic
rock
cds
ever
although
for
a
while
was
unfairly
criticized
as
corporate
rock
it's
not
hard
to
hear
why
these
accolades
are
laid
on
one
after
the
other
no
matter
how
anticlassic
rock
you
happen
to
be
it's
hard
not
to
start
tapping
your
feet
and
acknowledging
the
greatness
of
the
classic
beat
from
more
than
a
feeling
when
listening
the
vocals
soar
around
you
and
you
realize
that
no
matter
how
many
times
you
hear
the
song
it
will
never
turn
stale
next
up
comes
peace
of
mind
a
slightly
faster
song
with
quicker
vocals
and
another
classic
with
great
lyrics
and
guitars
it's
almost
impossible
in
this
review
to
simply
go
through
the
songs
as
each
one
is
a
hit
all
have
been
played
countless
times
and
are
mostly
likely
all
worthy
of
their
own
individual
reviews
the
only
song
that's
not
quite
up
to
par
on
boston
is
rock
n
roll
band
which
seems
more
like
an
echo
of
the
surrounding
songs
it's
worth
saying
though
that
the
song
isn't
all
that
bad
‚&auml&icirc
in
it's
own
right
it's
a
fine
song
‚&auml&icirc
but
on
an
album
that's
this
good
it
falls
by
the
wayside
to
some
extent
probably
the
best
thing
i
can
write
about
boston
is
this
if
you
don't
own
it
there's
no
better
time
to
repent
your
ways
and
buy
this
album
if
you
do
own
boston
there's
no
better
time
to
update
your
old
cd
with
a
new
remixed
and
sonically
superior
version
don't
look
back
while
most
praise
is
generally
directed
towards
their
first
album
that
doesn't
mean
boston's
second
outing
don't
look
back
is
unworthy
of
attention
the
name
is
ironic
in
this
case
what
boston
is
in
essence
doing
on
this
album
is
not
expanding
into
new
territories
and
instead
further
compacting
and
solidifying
their
unique
style
while
most
bands
would
be
(and
are)
chastised
for
essentially
staying
put
musically
it's
tricker
to
do
so
with
boston
as
the
music
is
just
so
good
the
title
song
don't
look
back
is
a
boston
classic
and
deservedly
so
containing
the
uplifting
tone
unique
vocal
harmony
and
guitar
riffs
that
make
the
band
great
the
overall
feel
to
don't
look
back
is
slightly
slower
paced
than
that
of
boston
with
songs
such
as
a
man
i'll
never
be
and
used
to
bad
news
there's&not†a
noticeable
amount
of
filler
material
on
this
disc
(it's
easy
and
used
to
bad
news)
and
an
instrumental
track
the
journey
that
even
at
a
short
1
minute
and
46
seconds
seems
to
drag
on
and
on
these
flaws
are
probably
due
more
in
part
to
the
rush
recorded
status
of
the
album
rather
than
an
actual
drop
in
quality
even
with
these
complaints
it's
worth
owning
the
album
for
the
amazing
times
when
everything
clicks
(which
thankfully
is
fairly
often)
on
tracks
like
feelin'
satisfied
don't
be
afraid
and
of
course
don't
look
back
the
sound
quality
is
again
very
good
on
this
new
remastered
disc
highly
recommended
for
both
boston
fans
and
those
new
to
the
band

magazine's
vice
president/editor
in
chief
mike
mettler
recently
did
an
interview
with
tom
as
well
he
states
you've
never
heard
boston
and
don't
look
back
like
this
before
these
remasters
show
just
how
far
ahead
of
his
time
tom
scholz
was
(and
still
is)

they're
two
of
the
bestsounding
cds
i've
ever
listened
to
run
don't
walk
(and
don't
look
back!)
and
go
buy
these
two
classic
discs
immediately
your
ears
will
be
glad
you
did
i
spent
about
50
minutes
alone
just
on
'more
than
a
feeling'
what
a
difference!
the
bass
on
the
intro
is
indeed
much
fuller
brad's
vocals
are
also
much
fuller
and
even
wider
in
scope
on
previous
cd
versions
it's
almost
like
he's
singing
through
water
the
difference
is
quite
noticeable
when
he
sings
'away'
at
the
040
mark
and
especially
'away

hey'
@226
the
drums
are
punchier
(you
can
feel
the
kick
right
in
the
gut)
and
cymbal
and
stickwork
are
crisper
in
general
brad's
vocals
are
a
revelation
throughout
both
albums
making
me
feel
like
he
was
singing
right
in
front
of
me
a
live
interview
with
tom
will
be
broadcast
in
the
future

soundandvisionmagcom

boston

'boston'
and
'don't
look
back'

(epic/legacy)
those
who
go
beyond
the
music
and
read
the
liner
notes
of
these
two
reissued
albums
might
laugh
when
the
writer
suggests
a
kinship
between
the
joyous
energy
of
boston's
radiofriendly
classic
rock
and
nirvana's
infectious
'90s
hit
smells
like
teen
spirit
hardcore
fans
of
one
or
the
other
band
might
even
find
the
idea
blasphemous
but
an
open
mind
will
see
the
truth
to
it
beneath
boston's
polished
layers
of
guitars
and
nirvana's
stubbornly
distorted
poppunk
beats
the
same
youthful
exuberance

different
decade
same
idea
even
steve
jones
guitarist
for
iconic
punkers
the
sex
pistols
has
admitted
to
secretly
liking
more
than
a
feeling
at
a
time
when
his
band
was
supposed
to
be
tearing
down
the
dinosaur
rock
of
bands
like
boston
what
boston
mastermind
tom
scholz
and
his
bandmates
did
on
these
two
albums
was
marry
the
youthful
energy
and
concerns
of
early
rock
'n'
roll
to
the
big
sound
of
heroes
such
as
led
zepplin
but
ditching
all
the
mystical
pomp
and
circumstance
of
mid'70s
hard
rock
in
a
way
boston
was
an
alternative
to
the
alternative
giving
kids
who
were
turned
off
by
the
rigid
ideology
of
punk
and
the
vapid
pulse
of
disco
a
way
to
rock
although
there
are
no
bonus
tracks
and
the
liner
notes
will
interest
only
the
historicallyminded
the
updated
sound
quality
alone
makes
this
pair
of
reissues
worthy
of
purchase
