teignmouth
england
united
kingdom
(1994
–
present)
muse
are
an
alternative
rock
band
from
teignmouth
england
united
kingdom
the
band
consists
of
matthew
bellamy
on
lead
vocals
piano
keyboard
and
guitar
chris
wolstenholme
on
backing
vocals
and
bass
guitar
and
dominic
howard
on
drums
and
percussion
they
have
been
friends
since
their
formation
in
early
1994
and
changed
band
names
a
number
of
times
(such
as
gothic
plague
fixed
penalty
and
rocket
baby
dolls)
before
adopting
the
name
muse
since
the
release
of
their
fourth
album
morgan
nicholls
has
also
appeared
with
the
band
at
live
performances
to
provide
keyboards
samples/synth
and
backing
vocals
their
sound
is
a
blend
of
alternative
rock
classical
music
electronica
metal
spanish
guitars
and
progressive
rock
usually
they
use
the
bass
line
as
the
driving
force
often
with
the
guitar
providing
only
an
extra
layer
to
the
song
rather
than
carrying
the
melody
the
bass
has
distortion
and
other
effects
applied
to
it
to
achieve
a
greater
weight
allowing
the
guitar
to
digress
from
the
main
tune
and
play
higher
notes
another
peculiarity
is
muse&acutes
piano
style
in
many
of
their
songs
their
music
has
been
inspired
by
the
works
of
romantic
pianistcomposers
such
as
rachmaninoff
tchaikovsky
and
liszt
and
has
thus
resulted
in
a
fusion
of
romantic
style
with
modern
rock
the
band
is
known
for
their
energetic
live
performances
and
front
man
matthew
bellamy’s
eccentric
and
avid
interests
in
global
conspiracy
extraterrestrial
life
theology
and
the
apocalypse
(as
much
as
in
space
and
theoretical
physics)
their
lyrical
themes
involve
madcap
conspiracy
theory
revolutionary
rabblerousing
weird
stuff
about
aliens
(or
zetas
if
you
please)
religions
and
other
such
classic
muse
concerns
