frontman
chris
martin
credits
1980s
norwegian
pop
band
aha
for
inspiring
him
to
form
his
own
band
coldplay’s
early
material
was
often
compared
to
that
of
jeff
buckley
and
radiohead
while
also
drawing
comparisons
to
u2
and
travis
since
the
release
of
the
band’s
debut
album
parachutes
(2000)
coldplay
has
also
drawn
influence
from
other
sources
including
echo
and
the
bunnymen
and
george
harrison
on
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
(2002)
and
johnny
cash
and
kraftwerk
for
xy
(2005)
coldplay
are
one
of
very
few
current
british
music
acts
to
achieve
major
success
in
north
america
despite
their
large
worldwide
popularity
the
band
has
remained
protective
of
how
their
music
is
used
in
the
media
refusing
its
use
for
product
endorsements
in
the
past
coldplay
had
turned
down
multimillion
dollar
contracts
from
gatorade
diet
coke
and
gap
who
wanted
to
use
the
songs
“yellow”
trouble
and
don’t
panic
respectively
according
to
martin
“we
wouldn’t
be
able
to
live
with
ourselves
if
we
sold
the
songs’
meanings
like
that”
on
the
other
hand
“yellow”
has
been
used
to
back
tv
trailers
for
“the
simpsons”
and
“viva
la
vida”
from
their
latest
album
