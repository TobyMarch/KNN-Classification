the

be
an
allusion
to
the

political
party
bloc
qu&eacuteb&eacutecois
however
moakes
said
on
the
group's
official
internet
forum
that
it
was
more
a
merging
of
the
eastern
blocs
and
the
western
parties
in
the
political
sense
he
also
notes
that
the
name
was
not
explicitly
driven
by

rather
it
looked

lissack
told
a
canadian
newspaper
the
national
post
that
the
band
are
planning
to
take
an
indefinite
hiatus
following
their
appearance
at
the

musical
style
[edit]
bloc
party's
brand
of
guitar
rock
draws
on
influences
such
as
the
cure
joy
division
sonic
youth[2]
blur[91]
and
the
smiths[7]
okereke
has
also
stated
that
mogwai's
album
mogwai
young
team
changed
his
life
by
being
his
musical
year
zero[92]
okereke
also
cites
suede
as
a
major
influence
he
says
dog
man
star
was
the
first
record
he
fell
in
love
with[93]
particular
parallels
were
made
between
bloc
party
and
gang
of
four
upon
their
arrival
on
the
music
scene[2]
yet
the
band
were
mildly
infuriated
at
such
references
claiming
they
had
never
particularly
liked
gang
of
four[33]
to
achieve
their
unique
style
numerous
delay
and
other
effects
pedals
are
implemented[94]
during
the
recording
of
second
album
a
weekend
in
the
city
the
band
suggested
it
would
contain
some
truly
r'n'b
styled
beats
a
song
where
[tong]
and
[moakes]
play
drums
simultaneously
[with]
both
eggshellthin
fragility
and
trouserflapping
hugeness[95]
as
opposed
to
their
typical
sound
the
style
has
been
compared
to
and
inspired
by
such
bands
as
radiohead
u2
depeche
mode
and
bj&oumlrk[4]
some
of
the
most
noticeable
changes
between
debut
silent
alarm
and
a
weekend
in
the
city
are
that
the
songs
became
more
layered
and
less
raw
due
to
inclusion
of
string
arrangements[96]
with
the
release
of
flux
bloc
party's
style
became
even
more
diverse
with
the
inclusion
of
electronic
music[96]
mercury
saw
bloc
party
distance
themselves
even
further
from
the
traditional
guitar
band
setup
by
experimenting
with
dark
electronic
sounds
and
a
brass
section
inspired
by
siouxsie
and
the
banshees[3][97]
the
band's
third
album
intimacy
also
features
synths
processed
drum
beats
and
loops
vocal
manipulation
and
choral
arrangements[98]
even
though
the
album
is
influenced
by
electronic
music
the
band
still
has
not
lost
their
feel
for
guitar
music
for
example
in
a
recent
interview
okereke
said
that
the
band
is
starting
to
miss
their
more
traditional
sound
and
confirmed
that
may
be
the
way
fourth
album
is
headed[99]
however
tong
contradicted
this
stating
there's
every
chance
we
might
go
back
to
more
orthodox
arrangements
or
things
that
resemble
a
traditional
band
but
i
don't
think
we'll
ever
write
songs
like
we
did
on
silent
alarm
again[100]

this

to

it
