dierks
bentley
songs
have
consistently
alternated
between
rowdy
party
anthems
and
deeply
sensual
slow
jams
few
artists
can
pull
off
both
with
such
proficiency
he’s
been
nothing
if
not
an
original
since
debuting
in
2003
‘what
was
i
thinkin”
was
his
debut
single
and
it
became
one
of
the
most
played
songs
of
the
decade
however
he
followed
that
up
with
nine
more
no
1
hits
so
there
is
stiff
competition
for
the
top
spot
on
this

'how
am
i
doin''
from
'dierks
bentley'
(2003)
&nbsp
&nbsp
there
are
few
better
revenge
songs
that
bentley's
hit
from
his
2003
selftitled
album
what
makes
it
wonderful
is
that
the
music
absolutely
matches
the
message
it's
fun
and
unforgiving
well
i
don't
know
what
you
were
thinking
/
running
'round
on
me
/
well
now
you
say
you're
sorry

well
honey
i
agree
he
sings
just
before
the
final
chorus
this
dierks
bentley
song
is
a
cathartic
slap
to
the
face
to
any
lover
who
has
spurned
you

'my
last
name'
from
'dierks
bentley'
(2003)
&nbsp
&nbsp
fans
demanded
this
song
be
added
to
the
top
10
dierks
bentley
songs
list
the
ballad
was
his
second
release
and
it
wasn't
nearly
the
commercial
success
of
some
others
it's
about
pride

especially
in
where
you
come
from
bentley
isn't
known
for
being
a
country
chestthumper
but
he
wears
the
emotion
well
during
this
track
from
2003

'long
trip
alone'
from
'long
trip
alone'
(2006)
&nbsp
&nbsp
maybe
one
could
call
'long
trip
alone'
bentley's
dark
album
as
the
first
two
singles
lacked
the
upbeat
traveling
rhythm
for
which
he'd
become
known
this
song
about
asking
a
girl
to
take
him
back
was
only
a
top
10
hit
but
it
has
maintained
a
place
on
country
radio
better
than
some
of
his
other
ballads
so
maybe
you
could
walk
with
me
a
while
/
and
maybe
i
could
rest
beneath
your
smile
he
sings
simple
lyrics
yet
from
bentley's
lips
there's
so
much
more
unspoken

'lot
of
leavin'
left
to
do'
from
'modern
day
drifter'
(2005)
&nbsp
&nbsp
few
artists
are
as
influenced
by
their
producer
as
bentley
is
by
brett
beavers
together
they've
been
enormously
successful
crafting
a
sound
that
borrows
from
bakersfield
but
adds
a
whole
lot
of
heart
for
the
first
time
fans
got
an
idea
of
how
important
bluegrass
music
is
on
this
no
1
hit
and
the
'modern
day
drifter'
album
he'd
go
on
to
include
more
and
more
pickin'
and
grinnin'
before
releasing
an
entire
bluegrass
album
in
2010

'i
wanna
make
you
close
your
eyes'
from
'feel
that
fire'
(2009)
&nbsp
&nbsp
bentley
was
well
on
his
way
to
becoming
a
heartthrob
before
this
2009
top
5
hit
it's
a
simple
love
song
about
falling
into
a
woman's
arms
after
a
long
day
and
then
seeing
where
it
goes
from
there
you
can
make
me
work
for
it
girl
if
you
want
to
/
just
leave
a
trail
for
me
to
follow
you
into
the
bedroom
he
sings
while
the
35yearold
might
not
be
your
typical
country
hunk
he
sure
sings
that
way
in
this
song

'5150'
from
'home'
(2012)
&nbsp
&nbsp
'5150'
the
charttopping
gold
single
from
2012
helped
make
'home'
a
big
success
this
track
went
back
to
the
sound
that
made
bentley
famous
and
cleverly
used
the
police
code
for
a
mentally
unstable
person
in
the
title
and
chorus
somehow
nobody
was
offended

the
song
must
be
too
catchy

'free
and
easy
(down
the
road
i
go)'
from
'long
trip
alone'
(2006)
&nbsp
&nbsp
after
four
straight
ballads
bentley
fans
were
ready
to
have
fun
again

and
they
did
during
the
summer
of
2007
with
this
top
5
hit
while
this
isn't
the
song
that
fans
most
identify
bentley
with
it
may
be
the
one
he
seems
most
comfortable
singing
the
lyrics
seem
to
fit
his
personality
i
could
make
a
million
or
wind
up
broke
/
free
and
easy
down
the
road
i
go
/
can't
take
it
with
you
when
you
go
so
/
free
and
easy
down
the
road
i
go
he
sings
it's
a
great
life

'home'
from
'home'
(2012)
&nbsp
&nbsp
song
and
single
of
the
year
nominations
helped
secure
'home'
a
place
on
the
top
10
dierks
bentley
songs
list
the
album
was
bentley's
first
since
releasing
a
bluegrass
project
and
this
single
didn't
exactly
go
right
back
to
where
he
was
before
that
diversion
instead
it
mixed
a
few
themes
(pride
patriotism)
creating
a
new
style
for
the
singer
that
he's
built
upon
in
future
releases
'home'
was
a
no
1
gold
single
in
2012

'come
a
little
closer'
from
'modern
day
drifter'
(2005)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
second
single
from
'modern
day
drifter'
found
bentley
pouring
on
the
romance
a
la
conway
twitty
few
women
could
resist
the
sultry
message
of
this
song
it
was
a
surprising
change
of
pace
for
a
man
who
until
then
had
mostly
been
about
uptempo
bluegrass
inspired
rockers
come
a
little
closer
baby
/
i
feel
like
layin'
you
down
/
on
a
bed
of
sweet
surrender
/
where
we
can
work
it
all
out
he
sings
with
poetic
confidence
to
open
the
track
one
of
the
top
dierks
bentley
songs
'come
a
little

is
one

two

the
no

was
also
his
first
to
