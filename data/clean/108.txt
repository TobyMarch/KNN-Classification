history
[edit]
formation
and
early
years
(1993–1994)
[edit]
duke
erikson
and
butch
vig
had
been
in
numerous
bands
including
spooner
and
fire
town
(with
steve
marker
as
a
sound
engineer)
in
1983
vig
and
marker
founded
smart
studios
in
madison
and
vig's
production
work
brought
him
to
the
attention
of
sub
pop
spooner
reunited
in
1990
and
released
another
record
but
disbanded
in
1993
as
vig
and
marker's
career
as
producers
gained
strength[15]
in
1994
as
vig
become
kind
of
burned
out
on
doing
really
long
records
he
got
together
with
erikson
and
marker
and
they
started
doing
remixes
for
acts
such
as
u2
depeche
mode
nine
inch
nails
and
house
of
pain
the
remixes
featured
different
instrumentation
and
often
highlighting
new
guitar
hooks
and
bass
grooves
this
experience
inspired
the
three
men
to
form
a
band
where
they
wanted
to
take
that
remix
sensibility
and
somehow
translate
it
into
all
of
the
possibilities
of
a
band
setup[16]
an
early
comment
that
their
work
sounded
like
garbage
inspired
the
band's
name[4]
initial
sessions
with
vig
on
vocals
along
with
the
members'
past
work
with
allmale
groups
led
to
the
band's
desire
for
a
woman
on
lead[17]
marker
declared
that
their
desire
for
a
female
vocalist
was
one
who
didn't
have
a
high
chirpy
girly
quality
to
her
voice
similar
to
patti
smith
and
chrissie
hynde
and
vig
added
that
they
wanted
someone
that
could
sing
in
an
understated
way
in
contrast
to
these
alternarock
singers
[that]
have
a
tendency
to
scream[18]
marker
was
watching
120
minutes
when
he
saw
the
music
video
for
angelfish's
suffocate
me
he
showed
the
video
to
erikson
and
vig
while
their
manager
shannon
o'shea
tracked
down
the
band's
singer
shirley
manson
when
manson
was
contacted
she
did
not
know
who
vig
was
and
was
urged
to
check
the
credits
on
nevermind
the
popular
nirvana
album
which
vig
produced[4]
on
april
8
1994
manson
met
erikson
marker
and
vig
for
the
first
time
in
london
later
that
evening
vig
was
informed
of
nirvana
frontman
kurt
cobain's
suicide[4]
garbage
was
put
on
hold
until
angelfish
was
finished
touring
north
america
in
support
of
live[19]
erikson
marker
and
vig
attended
the
metro
chicago
date
and
manson
was
invited
to
madison
to
audition
for
the
band
the
audition
did
not
go
well
but
manson
socialized
with
the
men
while
there
and
they
found
they
had
a
similar
taste
in
music
angelfish
disbanded
at
the
end
of
the
live
tour
manson
called
o'shea
and
asked
to
audition
again
feeling
that
it
would
work
out[4]
manson
described
her
first
session
with
the
band
as
a
disaster
as
she
had
no
experience
as
a
session
musician
and
she
and
the
band
were
two
parties
totally
uncomfortable
with
the
situation
but
the
mutual
disdain
from
that
meeting
managed
to
pull
the
band
together
the
first
songs
were
skeletal
versions
of
the
songs
stupid
girl
queer
and
vow
which
led
to
some
adlibbed
lyrics
by
manson[20][21]
manson
had
never
written
a
song
prior
to
this
session
nevertheless
this
time
she
was
invited
to
join
the
band[4]
lyrics
were
penned
at
a
cabin
in
the
north
woods
of
wisconsin
while
the
songs
were
recorded
at
smart
studios[22]
conscious
of
the
grunge
genre
that
had
made
their
names
particularly
vig's
the
band
made
every
effort
to
avoid
sounding
similar
deliberately
striving
to
make
a
pop
record[23]
garbage
sent
out
demo
tapes
with
no
bio
to
avoid
a
bidding

[edit]
garbage
started
proper
work
on
their
fourth
record
in
march
2003
writing
right
between
the
eyes
in
30
minutes
it
was
a
false
start[63]
recording
for
the
album
was
halted
during
the
summer
when
singer
shirley
manson
underwent
surgery
on
her
right
vocal
cord
and
was
not
given
the
okay
to
sing
again
until
august[64]
by
october
due
to
rising
tension
within
the
band
and
a
breakdown
in
communication[65]
vig
relocated
to
los
angeles
while
manson
returned
to
scotland[66]
during
the
christmas
period
vig
encountered
excited
garbage
fans
eager
to
hear
how
the
album
was
going
not
having
the
heart
to
tell
them
garbage
had
effectively
split
he
namedropped
titles
to
them
after
this
encounter
he
realized
there
was
still
something
left
in
the
band[66]
in
january
2004
garbage
reconvened
in
los
angeles
with
dust
brother
john
king
drummer
matt
chamberlain
bassist
justin
meldaljohnsen[67]
and
on
february
6
dave
grohl
performed
drums
on
bad
boyfriend[68]
his
performance
was
regarded
by
the
band
as
raising
the
bar
for
the
record[66]
following
the
john
king
sessions
the
band
formally
relocated
to
los
angeles
and
wrote
two
new
songs
metal
heart
and
boys
wanna
fight[66]
which
were
more
energetic
songs
than
the
band
had
been
writing
as
well
as
lyrically
more
overtly
political[66]
both
songs
referencing
the
us
and
uk
led
2003
invasion
of
iraq
in
2005
lead

(2007–2008)
[edit]
garbage
ended
their
18month
hiatus
on
january

organised
by

prior
to
this
garbage
had
been
sharing
song
ideas
via
the
internet
and
were
keen
on
getting
into
the
recording
studio
to
complete
them[74]
garbage
began
work
on
the
new
songs
in
earnest
during
february
and

documentary
film
titled
thanks
for
your
uhhh
support
featuring
backstage
and
behindthescenes
footage
live
performances
and
interviews[76]
vig
stated
that
garbage
was
considering
mid2008
to
begin
making
a
fifth
album
saying
we're
thinking
about
it
i
think
we're
more
interested
in
making
something
that's
much
more
primal
and
stripped
down
absolute
garbage
is
the
postscript
to
chapter
one
whatever
we
do
next
will
definitely
be
chapter
two[77]
in
may
2008
it
was
announced
that
manson
would
be
joining
the
cast
of
us
tv
show
terminator
the
sarah
connor
chronicles
in
a
regular
role[78]

not
your
kind

and
recent
activity
(2010–present)
[edit]
on
february
1
2010
it
was
confirmed
through
shirley
manson's
official
facebook
profile
that
she
spent
a
week
in
the
studio
with
her
bandmates[81]
in
the
post
manson
wrote
guess
who
i
just
spent
a
week
in
the
studio
with?
would
you
be
pleased
if
i
said
one
of
them
was
called
steve
and
one
of
them
was
called
duke
and
another
was
a
grammywinning
producer?[81]
in
october
2010
it
was
officially
confirmed
that
garbage
were
recording
their
fifth
studio
album[82]
on
september
17
2011
the
band
clarified
that
their
forthcoming
11track
lp
would
be
mixed
by
october
17
while
another
12
songs
will
be
finalized
by
the
end
of
the
year
and
see
release
as
bsides
extra
tracks
and
maybe
one
might
even
come
your
way
simply
as
a
christmas
present
from
garbage
as
a
thank
you
to
you
all
for
sticking
around[83]
though
this
did
not
materialize
the
band
announced
to
billboard
that
their
fifth
studio
album
will
be
released
independently
of
any
major
label
support
with
vig
confirming
we're
looking
at
this
as
free
agents
we're
out
of
all
our
corporate
responsibilities
from
the
past
and
initially
we
thought
that
was
terrifying
but
now
we
think
it's
liberating
we're
going
to
put
the
record
out
on
our
own
label
and
just
figure
out
how
to
license
it
and
market
it
because
we
want
it
under
our
control
vig
also
stated
that
the
group
would
tour
in
support
of
the
record[84]
in
another
interview
with
spin
lead
singer
shirley
manson
stated
people
we've
played
it
for
[have
said]
it
sounds
like
the
first
record
and
i'm
thinking
to
myself
'it
doesn't
sound
anything
like
the
first
record'
but
there
is
an
energy
there
that's
i
think
reminiscent
of
the
first
record
a
sort
of
hungriness
is
there[85]
while
vig
told
rolling
stone
i
think
you
can
hear
some
energy
and
a
vibe
in
the
tracks
that
sounds
refreshing

a
little
bit
more
to
me
like
the
first
two
records
somehow
we
have
a
collective
sound
when
we
spin
the
ideas
through
the
four
of
our
brains
it
comes
out
and
it's
kind
of
a
thing
that's
identifiable[86]
on
january
6
2012
the
band
announced
that
they
had
entered

help
garbage's
intention
is
to
make
poplike
songs
which
mixed
a
variety
of
genres
with
steve
marker
saying
that
the
band
wanted
to
take
pop
music
and
make
it
as
horrible
sounding
as
we
can[17]
shirley
manson
has
stated
that
the
band
itself
used
to
describe
[their
sound]
as
scifi
pop
because
we
felt
it
was
taking
a
futuristic
approach[101]
vig
has
said
the
crossoverheavy
sound
was
inspired
by
the
band's
background
with
remixes
where
songs
would
be
rearranged
to
every
musical
style
to
which
they
held
interest[102]
and
also
that
he
grew
up
listening
to
everything
from
pop
radio
and
opera
to
country
music
and
polka
so
i
really
thought
that
garbage
would
be
an
interesting
and
eclectic
thing
to
do[17]
