beginnings
and
peak
[edit]
since
its
inception
foreigner
has
been
led
by
english
musician
mick
jones
(former
member
of
nero
and
the
gladiators
johnny
hallyday's
band
spooky
tooth
and
the
leslie
west
band)
who
after
the
collapse
of
the
leslie
west
band
found
himself
stranded
in
nyc
where
west's
manager
bud
prager
took
him
under
his
wing
and
encouraged
jones
to
continue
his
songwriting
and
rehearse
a
band
of
his
own
in
a
space
prager
had
near
his
new
york
office
jones
got
together
with
new
york
keyboardist
al
greenwood
(who
had
just
played
with
former
flash
members
colin
carter
and
mike
hough
in
a
group
called
storm)
drummer
stan
williams
and
louisiana
bassist
jay
davis
(later
with
rod
stewart)
and
began
jamming
another
friend
stories
singer
ian
lloyd
was
brought
in
to
sing
but
jones
decided
the
chemistry
was
not
quite
right
and
retained
only
greenwood
as
he
renewed
his
search
for
players
during
a
session
for
ian
lloyd's
album
jones
met
up
with
transplanted
englishman
and
exking
crimson
member
ian
mcdonald
and
another
session
for
ian
hunter
unearthed
another
fellow
brit
in
drummer
dennis
elliott
but
after
auditioning
about
forty
or
fifty
singers
the
right
vocalist
was
becoming
harder
to
come
by
until
jones
dragged
out
an
old
black
sheep
album
given
to
him
backstage
at
a
spooky
tooth
concert
a
few
years
prior
by
that
group's
lead
singer
lou
gramm
jones
put
in
a
call
to
gramm
who
was
back
in
his
hometown
of
rochester
new
york
after
black
sheep's
break
up
and
sent
him
a
plane
ticket
to
nyc
gramm
proved
to
be
the
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
and
long
island
bassist
ed
gagliardi
completed
the
new
sextet
a
name
trigger
was
tentatively
agreed
to
and
was
the
name
that
appeared
on
their
demo
tape
but
it
was
passed
on
by
all
the
record
companies
it
was
delivered
to
john
kalodner
a
former
journalist
and
radio
programmer
who
was
working
in
ar
at
atlantic
records
happened
to
spot
a
tape
on
atlantic
president
jerry
greenberg's
desk
with
the
trigger
identification
on
it
kalodner
had
just
been
to
hear
an
outfit
called
trigger
and
realized
that
this
was
not
the
same
band
he
convinced
greenberg
that
at
least
one
of
the
songs
on
the
tape
could
be
a
big
hit
and
to
look
into
signing
this
group
immediately
because
the
trigger
name
was
already
taken
jones
came
up
with
the
foreigner
moniker
from
the
fact
that
no
matter
what
country
they
were
in
three
would
be
foreigners
because
he
mcdonald
and
elliott
were
english
while
gramm
greenwood
and
gagliardi
were
americans[6]
in
november
1976
after
six
months
of
rehearsals
the
newly
christened
foreigner
started
recording
their
debut
album
with
producers
john
sinclair
and
gary
lyons
at
the
hit
factory
but
switched
to
atlantic
recording
studios
where
they
finished
recording
the
basic
tracks
and
completed
the
overdubs
the
first
attempt
at
mixing
the
album
was
done
at
sarm
studios
london
but
due
to
the
band's
dissatisfaction
with
the
results
the
album
was
remixed
back
at
atlantic
by
mick
jones
and
jimmy
douglass
bud
prager
signed
on
as
the
group's
manager
a
role
he
would
continue
in
for
the
next
17
years
the
band's
debut
foreigner
was
released
in
march
1977
and
sold
more
than
four
million
copies
in
the
united
states
staying
in
the
top
20
for
a
year
with
such
hits
as
feels
like
the
first
time
cold
as
ice
and
long
long
way
from
home
by
may
1977
foreigner
was
already
headlining
theaters
and
had
already
scored
a
gold
record
for
the
first
album
not
long
afterwards
they
were
selling
out
us
basketball
and
hockey
rinks
and
after
almost
a
year
on
the
road
the
band
played
before
over
two
hundred
thousand
people
at
california
jam
ii
on
march
18
1978
their
sophomore
album
double
vision
(released
in
june
1978)
coproduced
by
keith
olsen
topped
their
previous
selling
five
million
records
and
spawned
hits
in
hot
blooded
the
title
track
double
vision
and
blue
morning
blue
day
in
april
1978
the
band
toured
europe
japan
and
australia
for
the
first
time
later
on
into
the
tour
elliott
injured
his
hand
prompting
the
band
to
call
in
ian
wallace
(exking
crimson)
to
fill
in
for
him
on
some
dates
of
the
tour
until
the
hand
was
healed
album
number
three
head
games
(september
1979)
coproduced
by
roy
thomas
baker
which
was
referred
to
by
gramm
as
their
grainiest
album
was
also
successful
because
of
the
thunderous
dirty
white
boy
and
another
title
track
hit
head
games
for
head
games
bassist
ed
gagliardi
was
replaced
by
englishman
rick
wills
in
his
autobiography
juke
box
hero
lou
explains
why
the
band
parted
ways
with
gagliardi
he
was
a
little
headstrong
and
had
his
own
ideas
that
weren't
always
compatible
with
what
we
were
trying
to
accomplish
ed
was
obstinate
at
times
playing
the
song
the
way
he
wanted
to
play
it
rather
than
the
way
it
was
drawn
up
mick
often
had
to
stop
sessions
to
get
ed
back
on
track
after
a
while
it
became
tiresome
and
slowed
down
the
recording
process
lou
went
on
to
say
that
he
was
disappointed
overall
with
head
games
and
thought
it
sounded
unfinished
it
ended
up
selling
about
two
million
fewer
than
its
predecessor
head
games
was
banned
in
some
stores
in
the
midwest
us
because
its
cover
shows
a
teen
girl
trying
to
remove
graffiti
from
a
men's
room
wall[citation
needed]
in
september
1980
cofounders
al
greenwood
and
ian
mcdonald
were
sacked
as
jones
wished
to
have
more
control
over
the
band
and
write
most
of
the
music
(along
with
gramm)
in
his
book
gramm
goes
on
to
talk
about
this
difficult
time
the
chemistry
that
made
the
band
right
in
the
beginning
didn't
necessarily
mean
it
would
always
be
right
i
think
a
pretty
major
communication
lapse
appeared
and
i
don't
think
anybody
really
knew
what
anybody
was
feeling—the
deep
inner
belief
about
the
direction
of
the
band
and
how
we
were
progressing
we
had
reached
a
point
where
there
was
alot
of
dissatisfaction
in
the
liner
notes
for
the
2000
release
juke
box
heroes
the
foreigner
anthology
mick
went
on
to
elaborate
further
ian
mcdonald
whom
i
consider
a
great
musician
and
multiinstrumentalist
began
to
focus
more
and
more
on
guitar
playing
while
i
believed
his
true
talent
lay
more
in
the
dimensional
and
creative
imagery
he
gave
the
first
two
albums
al
greenwood
our
keyboard
wiz
and
a
very
important
part
of
the
foreigner
sound
at
the
beginning
had
also
started
to
focus
more
on
songwriting
although
both
their
contributions
to
the
band
had
been
vital
a
conflict
was
developing
about
the
musical
direction
of
the
band
i
just
felt
we
needed
to
clarify
it
so
lou
rick
dennis
and
i
made
the
decision
and
that's
when
we
went
down
to
four
the
band
was
now
stripped
down
to
a
quartet
with
session
players
brought
in
as
needed
to
record
or
tour
(see
below

complete
list

joined

a
gospelinspired

us

the

high

[edit]
during
the
los

riots
in
late
april

where
mick
jones
had
gone
to
meet
with
lou
gramm
they
both
ended
up
sequestered
due
to
a
city
curfew
they
decided
to
use
their
time
together
putting
a
twoyear
feud
to
rest
and
resurrecting
their
partnership
i
flew
to
los
angeles
during
the
riots
says
gramm
we
got
flown
to
john
wayne
airport
instead
of
lax
because
they
were
shooting
at
the
planes
mick
and
i
were
holed
up
in
the
sunset
marquis
in
la
with
armed
security
guards
walking
around
on
the
roof
it
was
a
little
weird
to
say
the
least
gramm
ended
up
rejoining
foreigner
(bringing
along
his
shadow
king
bandmate
bassist
bruce
turgon)
and
produced
the

comeback
album
mr
moonlight
in
japan
this
album
was
not
released
in
the
us
until
february
1995
but
fared
even
worse
than
unusual
heat
although
the
ballad
until
the
end
of
time
was
a
minor
hit
reaching
no
42
on
the
billboard

100
in
the
spring
of

ron
wikso

gramm
underwent
surgery
to
remove
a
brain
tumor
the
medications
he
was
prescribed
caused
considerable
weight
gain
and
affected
his
singing
