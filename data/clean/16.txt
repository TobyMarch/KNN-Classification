early
life
[edit]
beck
was
born
in
los
angeles
california
to
david
campbell
a
canadian
musician
and
bibbe
hansen
a
visual
artist
and
former
warhol
superstar
bibbe's
maternal
grandmother
was
jewish
while
bibbe's
father
al
hansen
was
partly
of
norwegian
descent[5][6]
his
mother
was
raised
amid
new
york's
andy
warhol
factory
art
scene
of
the
1960s[7]
but
moved
to
california
at
age
17
where
she
met
campbell[8]
his
father
is
a
canadianborn
arranger
composer
and
conductor
who
worked
on
hundreds
of
albums
and
numerous
films[7]
beck
began
life
in
a
rooming
house
near
downtown
los
angeles
as
a
child
he
lived
in
a
declining
neighborhood
just
off
hollywood
boulevard[9]
by
the
time
we
left
there
they
were
ripping
out
miles
of
houses
en
masse
and
building
lowrent
giant
apartment
blocks
he
later
recalled[8]
the
lowerclass
family
struggled
financially
moving
to
hoover
and
ninth
street
a
neighborhood
populated
primarily
by
koreans
and
salvadorian
refugees[8]
he
was
sent
for
a
time
to
live
with
his
maternal
grandparents
in
kansas
with
beck
later
remarking
that
i
think
they
were
kind
of
concerned
about
his
weird
home
life[10]
since
his
paternal
grandfather
was
a
presbyterian
minister
beck
grew
up
influenced
by
church
music
and
hymns[10]
beck
also
spent
time
in
europe
with
his
maternal
grandfather
al
hansen
a
visual
collage
artist
and
a
pioneer
in
the
avantgarde
fluxus
movement[7]
after
his
parents
separated
when
he
was
ten[8]
beck
stayed
with
his
mother
and
brother
in
los
angeles
where
he
was
influenced
by
the
city's
diverse
musical
offerings—everything
from
hip
hop
to
latin
music
and
his
mother's
art
scene—all
of
which
would
later
reappear
in
his
recorded
and
published
work[citation
needed]
beck
obtained
his
first
guitar
at
16
and
became
a
street
musician
often
playing
lead
belly
covers
at
lafayette
park[11]
during
his
teens
beck
discovered
the
music
of
sonic
youth
pussy
galore
and
x
but
remained
uninterested
in
most
music
outside
folk
until
many
years
into
his
career[7][8]
the
first
contemporary
music
that
made
a
direct
connection
with
beck
was
hip
hop
which
he
first
heard
on
grandmaster
flash
records
in
the
early
1980s[8]
growing
up
in
a
predominantly
latin
district
he
found
himself
the
only
white
child
at
his
school
and
he
quickly
learned
to
breakdance[8]
when
he
was
17
beck
grew
fascinated
after
hearing
a
mississippi
john
hurt
record
at
a
friend's
house[12]
and
spent
hours
in
his
room
trying
to
emulate
the
finger
picking
of
the
countryblues
guitarist[10]
shortly
thereafter
beck
explored
blues
and
folk
music
further
discovering
woody
guthrie
and
blind
willie
johnson[12]
feeling
like
a
total
outcast
beck
dropped
out
of
school
after
junior
high[12]
he
later
said
that
although
he
felt
school
was
important
he
felt
unsafe
there[9]
when
he
applied
to
the
new
performing
arts
high
school
downtown
he
was
rejected[13]
his
brother
channing
took
him
to
postbeat
jazz
places
in
echo
park
and
silver
lake
he
hung
out
at
the
los
angeles
city
college
perusing
records
books
and
old
sheet
music
in
its
library
he
used
a
fake
id
to
sit
in
on
classes
there
and
he
also
befriended
a
literature
instructor
and
his
poet
wife[13]
he
soon
began
a
stream
of
menial
jobs
including
loading
trucks
and
operating
a
leaf
blower[12]

[edit]
early
performing
and

releases
(1985–93)
[edit]
beck
began
as
a
folk
musician
switching
between
country
blues
delta
blues
and
more
traditional
rural
folk
music
in
his
teens[8]
he
began
performing
on
city
buses
often
covering
mississippi
john
hurt
alongside
original
sometimes
improvisational
compositions[10]
i'd
get
on
the
bus
and
start
playing
mississippi
john
hurt
with
totally
improvised
lyrics
some
drunk
would
start
yelling
at
me
calling
me
axl
rose
so
i'd
start
singing
about
axl
rose
and
the
levee
and
bus
passes
and
strychnine
mixing
the
whole
thing
up
he
later
recalled[10]
he
was
also
in
a
band
called
youthless
that
hosted
dadaistinspired
freeform
events
at
city
coffee
shops[8]
we
had
radio
shack
mics
and
this
homemade
speaker
and
we'd
draft
people
in
the
audience
to
recite
comic
books
or
do
a
beatbox
thing
or
we'd
tie
the
whole
audience
up
in
masking
tape
beck
recalled[8]
in
1989
beck
caught
a
bus
to
new
york
city
with
little
more
than
eight
dollars
and
a
guitar[10]
he
spent
the
summer
attempting
to
find
a
job
and
a
place
to
live
with
little
success[10]
beck
eventually
began
to
frequent
manhattan's
lower
east
side
and
stumbled
upon
the
tail
end
of
the
east
village's
antifolk
scene's
first
wave[7]
beck
became
involved
in
a
loose
posse
of
acoustic
musicians—including
cindy
lee
berryhill
kirk
kelly
paleface
and
lach
headed
by
roger
manning—whose
raggedness
and
eccentricity
placed
them
well
outside
the
acoustic
mainstream[12][14]
the
whole
mission
was
to
destroy
all
the
clich&eacutes
and
make
up
some
new
ones
said
beck
of
his
new
york
years
everybody
knew
each
other
you
could
go
up
onstage
and
say
anything
and
you
wouldn't
feel
weird
or
feel
any
pressure[14]
inspired
by
that
freedom
and
by
the
local
spokenword
performers
beck
began
to
write
freeassociative
surrealistic
songs
about
pizza
mtv
and
working
at
mcdonald's
turning
even
the
most
apparently
mundane
thoughts
into
songs[14]
beck
was
roommates
with
paleface
sleeping
on
his
couch
and
attending
open
mic
nights
together[15]
daunted
by
the
prospect
of
another
homeless
new
york
winter
beck
returned
to
his
home
of
los
angeles
in
early
1991[12][16]
i
was
tired
of
being
cold
tired
of
getting
beat
up
he
later
remarked
it
was
hard
to
be
in
new
york
with
no
money
no
place[]
i
kinda
used
up
all
the
friends
i
had
everyone
on
the
scene
got
sick
of
me[10]
back
in
los
angeles
beck
began
to
work
at
a
video
store
in
silver
lake
doing
things
like
alphabetizing
the
pornography
section[10]
he
began
performing
in
arty
silver
lake
clubs
and
coffeehouses—al's
bar
raji's
and
jabberjaw—along
with
other
underground
acts
such
as
ethyl
meatplow
and
that
dog[7][10][12]
in
order
to
keep
indifferent
audiences
engaged
in
his
music
beck
would
play
in
a
spontaneous
joking
manner[17]
i'd
be
banging
away
on
a
son
house
tune
and
the
whole
audience
would
be
talking
so
maybe
out
of
desperation
or
boredom
or
the
audience's
boredom
i'd
make
up
these
ridiculous
songs
just
to
see
if
people
were
listening
he
later
remarked[18]
virtually
an
unknown
to
the
public
and
an
enigma
to
those
who
met
him
beck
would
hop
onstage
between
acts
in
local
clubs
and
play
strange
folk
songs
accompanied
by
what
could
best
be
described
as
performance
art
while
sometimes
wearing
a
star
wars
stormtrooper
mask[12]
beck
met
someone
who
offered
to
help
record
demos
in
his
living
room
and
he
began
to
pass
cassette
tapes
around[12]
eventually
beck
gained
key
boosters
in
margaret
mittleman
the
west
coast's
director
of
talent
acquisitions
for
bmg
music
publishing
and
the
partners
behind
independent
record
label
bong
load
custom
records
tom
rothrock
rob
schnapf
and
brad
lambert[7]
schnapf
saw
beck
perform
at
jabberjaw
and
felt
he
would
suit
their
small
venture[12]
beck
expressed
a
loose
interest
in
hip
hop
and
rothrock
introduced
him
to
carl
stephenson
a
record
producer
for
rapalot
records[12][19]
in
1992
beck
visited
stephenson's
home
to
collaborate
the
result—the
slidesampling
hip
hop
track
loser—was
a
oneoff
experiment
that
beck
set
aside
going
back
to
his
folk
songs
making
his
home
tapes
such
as
golden
feelings
and
releasing
several
independent
singles[12]
mellow
gold
and
independent
albums
(1993–94)
[edit]
by
1993
beck
was
living
in
a
ratinfested
shed
near
a
los

alleyway
with
little
money[10]
bong

issued
loser
as
a
single
in
march
1993
on
12
vinyl
with
only
500
copies
pressed[20]
beck
felt
that
loser
was
mediocre
and
only
agreed
to
its
release
at
rothrock's
insistence[21]
loser
unexpectedly
received
radio
airplay
starting
in
los
angeles
where
college
radio
station
kxlu
was
the
first
to
play
it[20]
and
later
on
santa
monica
college
radio
station
kcrw
where
radio
host
chris
douridas
played
the
song
on
morning
becomes
eclectic
the
station's
flagship
music
program
i
called
the
record
label
that
day
and
asked
to
have
beck
play
live
on
the
air
douridas
said
he
came
in
that
friday
rapped
to
a
tape
of
'loser'
and
did
his
song
'mtv
makes
me
want
to
smoke
crack'[12]
that
night
beck
performed
at
the
los
angeles
club
cafe
troy
to
a
packed
audience
and
talent
scouts
from
major
labels[12]
the
song
then
spread
to
seattle
through
kndd
and
kroqfm
began
playing
the
song
on
an
almost
hourly
basis[20]
as
bong
load
struggled
to
press
more
copies
of
loser
beck
was
beset
with
offers
to
sign
with
major
labels[22]
during
the
fierce
bidding
war
in
november
beck
spent
several
days
in
olympia
washington
recording
material
with
calvin
johnson
of
beat
happening
which
would
later
see
release
the
following
year
on
johnson's
k
records
as
one
foot
in
the
grave[23]
a
fierce
bidding
war
ensued
with
geffen
records
ar
director
mark
kates
signing
beck
in
december
1993
despite
intense
competition
from
warner
bros
and
capitol[12][23]
beck's
nonexclusive
contract
with
geffen
allowed
him
an
unusual
amount
of
creative
freedom
with
beck
remaining
free
to
release
material
through
such
small
independent
labels
as
flipside
which
issued
the
sprawling
25track
collection
of
preloser
recordings
titled
stereopathetic
soulmanure
on
february
22
the
following
year[12][23]
by
the
time
beck
released
his
first
album
for
geffen
the
lowbudget
genreblending
mellow
gold
on
march
1[12]
loser
was
already
in
the
top
40
and
its
video
in
mtv's
buzz
bin[9]
loser
quickly
ascended
the
charts
in
the
us
reaching
a
peak
of
number
ten
on
the
billboard
hot
100
singles
chart
and
topping
the
modern
rock
tracks
chart[24]
the
song
also
charted
in
the
uk
australia
new
zealand
and
throughout
europe
beck's
newfound
position
of
attention
led
to
his
characterization
as
the
king
of
slackers
as
the
media
dubbed
him
the
center
of
the
new
socalled
slacker
movement[25]
critics
feeling
it
the
essential
followup
to
radiohead's
creep[23]
found
vacantness
in
the
lyrics
of
loser
strongly
associated
with
generation
x
although
beck
himself
strongly
contested
his
position
as
the
face
of
the
slacker
generation
slacker
my
ass
i
mean
i
never
had
any
slack
i
was
working
a
$4anhour
job
trying
to
stay
alive
that
slacker
stuff
is
for
people
who
have
the
time
to
be
depressed
about
everything[10]
backlash
and
odelay
(1994–97)
[edit]
feeling
as
though
he
was
constantly
trying
to
prove
myself[9]
beck
suffered
a
backlash
with
skeptics
denouncing
him
as
a
selfindulgent
fake
and
the
latest
marketing
opportunity[26]
in
the
summer
of
1994
beck
was
struggling
and
many
of
his
fellow
musicians
thought
he
had
lost
his
way[8]
combined
with
the
song's
wildly
popular
music
video
and
the
world
tour
beck
reacted
believing
the
attention
could
not
last
resulting
in
a
status
as
a
onehit
wonder
at
other
concerts
crowds
were
treated
to
twenty
minutes
of
reggae
or
miles
davis
or
jazzpunk
iterations
of
loser[13]
at
oneday
festivals
in
california
he
surrounded
himself
with
an
artnoise
combo
the
drummer
set
fire
to
his
cymbals
the
lead
guitarist
played
his
char
with
the
strings
faced
towards
his
body
and
beck
changed
the
words
to
loser
so
that
nobody
could
sing
along[8]
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
times
i
was
looking
at
faces
that
were
looking
back
at
me
with
complete
bewilderment—or
just
pointing
and
shaking
their
heads
and
laughing—while
performing
during
that
period
he
later
recalled[27]
despite
this
beck
gained
the
respect
of
his
peers
such
as
tom
petty
and
johnny
cash
and
created
an
entire
wave
of
bands
determined
to
recapture
the
mellow
gold
sound[28]
feeling
his
previous
releases
were
just
collections
of
demos
recorded
over
the
course
of
several
years
beck
desired
to
enter
the
studio
and
record
an
album
in
a
continuous
linear
fashion
which
became
odelay[27]
beck
blends
country
blues
rap
jazz
and
rock
on
odelay
the
result
of
a
year
and
half
of
feverish
cutting
pasting
layering
dubbing
and
of
course
sampling[11]
each
day
the
musicians
started
from
scratch[29]
often
working
on
songs
for
16
hours
straight[11]
odelay's
conception
lies
in
an
unfinished
studio
album
beck
first
embarked
on
following
the
success
of
loser
chronicling
the
difficult
time
he
experienced
there
was
a
cycle
of
everyone
dying
around
me
he
recalled
later[28]
he
was
constantly
recording
and
eventually
put
together
an
album
of
somber
orchestrated
folk
tunes
one
that
perhaps
could
have
been
a
commercial
blockbuster
along
with
similarly
themed
work
by
smashing
pumpkins
nine
inch
nails
and
nirvana[28]
instead
beck
plucked
one
song
from
it—the
odelay
album
closer
ramshackle—and
shelved
the
rest[8][28]
beck
was
introduced
to
the
dust
brothers
producers
of
the
beastie
boys'
album
paul's
boutique
whose
cutandpaste
sampleheavy
production
suited
beck's
vision
of
a
more
fun
accessible
album[citation
needed]
after
a
record
executive
explained
that
odelay
would
be
a
huge
mistake
he
spent
many
months
thinking
that
i'd
blown
it
forever[13]
odelay
was
released
on
june
18
1996
to
commercial
success
and
critical
acclaim
the
record
produced
several
hit
singles
including
where
it's
at
devils
haircut
and
the
new
pollution
and
was
nominated
for
the
grammy
award
for
album
of
the
year
in
1997
winning
a
grammy
award
for
best
alternative
music
album
as
well
as
a
grammy
award
for
best
male
rock

performance
for

it's
at

in

did

the
combined
buzz
gave
odelay
a
second
wind
leading
to
an
expanded
fan
base
and
additional
exposure[18]
beck
enjoyed
but
like
several
executives
at
geffen
was
bewildered
by
the
success
of
odelay
he
would
often
get
recognized
in
public
which
made
him
feel
strange
it's
just
weird
it
doesn't
feel
right
it
doesn't
feel
natural
to
me
i
don't
think
i
was
made
for
that
i
was
never

at

he
later
told

odelay
sold
two

[edit]
having
not
been
in

studio
since
deadweight
beck
felt
anxious
to
go
in
and
just
do
some
stuff
real
quick
and
compiled
several
songs
he
had
had
for
years[30]
beck
and
his
bandmates
hammered
out
fourteen
songs
in
fourteen
days
although
just
twelve
made
it
onto

mutations[30]
beck
decided
on
nigel
godrich
producer
for
radiohead's
ok
computer
the
previous
year
to
be
behind
the
boards
for
the
project[30]
godrich
was
leaving
the
united
states
for
england
in
a
short
time
which
led
to
the
album's
quick
production
schedule—no
looking
back
no
doctoring
anything[30]
the
whole
point
of
the
record
was
to
capture
the
performance
of
the
musicians
live
an
uncharacteristic
farcry
from
the
cutandpaste
aesthetic
of
odelay[30]
though
the
album
was
originally
slated
for
release
by
bong
load
records
geffen
intervened
and
issued
the
record
against
beck's
wishes[31][32]
the
artist
then
sought
to
void
his
contracts
with
both
record
labels
and
in
turn
the
labels
sued
him
for
breach
of
contract
the
litigation
went
on
for
years
and
it
remains
unclear
to
this
day
if
it
has
ever
been
completely
resolved[33]
beck
was
later
awarded
best
alternative
music
performance
for
mutations
at
the
42nd
grammy
awards[34]

beck's
next
studio
effort
was
originally
recorded
as
a
double
album
and
more
than
25
nearly
completed
songs
were
left
behind[27]
in
the
studio
beck
and
producers
studied
contemporary
hip
hop
and
rb
specifically
r

in
order
to
embrace
and
incorporate
those
influences
in
the
way
al

had
done
in

decades[27]

who
played
viola
and
arranged
some
of
the
strings
the
musicians
held
communal
meals
and
mountainbike
rides
on
dusty
trails
nearby
but
remained
focused
on
beck's
instructions
to
make
an
uptempo
album
that
would
be
fun
to
play
on
tour
night
after
night[29]
i
had
so
many
things
going
on
said
beck
of
the
recording
process
i
had
a
couple
of
rooms
of
computers
hooked
up
i
was
doing
b

for
japan
i
was

beats
in
one
room

someone
would
be
cooking
dinner
in
the
other
room[29]
in
november
1999
geffen
released
the
muchanticipated
midnite
vultures[35]
which
attracted
confusion
fans
and
critics
misguidedly
worried
whether
it
was
serious
or
a
goof
and
as
a
result
the
new
york
times
wrote
that
the
album
never
won
the
audience
it
deserved[36]
the
record
was
supported
by
an
extensive
world
tour
for
beck
it
was
a
return
to
the
highenergy
performances
that
had
been
his
trademark
as
far
back
as
lollapalooza
the
live
stage
set
included
a
red

that
descended
from

complemented

[edit]
in
2000
beck
and
his
fianc&eacutee
stylist
leigh
limon
ended
their
nineyear
relationship[39]
beck
lapsed
into
a
period
of
melancholy
and
introspection
during
which
he
wrote
the
bleak
acousticbased
tracks
later
found
on
sea
change[40]
beck
sat
on
the
songs
not
wanting
to
talk
about
his
personal
life
he
later
said
that
he
wanted
to
focus
on
music
and
not
really
strew
my
baggage
across
the
public
lobby
eventually
however
he
decided
the
songs
spoke
to
a
common
experience
(a
relationship
breakup)
and
that
it
would
not
seem
selfindulgent
to
record
them[41]
in
2001
beck
drifted
back
to
the
songs
and
called
producer
nigel
godrich[42]
retailers
initially
predicted
that
the
album
would
not
receive
much
radio
support
but
they
also
believed
that
beck's
maverick
reputation
and
critical
acclaim
in
addition
to
the
possibility
of
multiple
grammy
nominations
might
offset
sea
change's
uncommercial
sound[41]
sea
change
issued
by
geffen
in
september
2002
was
regardless
a
commercial
hit
and
critical
darling[36]
with
rolling

revering
it
as
the
best

beck
has
ever
made
[]
an
impeccable
album
of
truth
and
light
from
the
end
of
love
this
is
his
blood
on
the
tracks[43]
the
album
was
later
listed
by
the
magazine
as
one
of
the
best
records
of
the
decade
and
of
alltime
and
it
also
placed

on

tour
as
well
as
a
larger

with
the
flaming

as
beck's
opening
and

beck
was
playful
and
energetic
sometimes
throwing
in
covers
of
the
rolling
stones
big
star
the
zombies
and
the
velvet
underground[43][46]
following
the
release
of
sea
change
beck
felt
newer
compositions
were
sketches
for
something
more
evolved
in
the
same
direction
and
wrote
nearly
35
more
songs
in
the
coming
months
keeping
demos
of
them
on
tapes
in
a
suitcase[27]
during
his
solo
tour
the
tapes
were
left
backstage
during
a
stop
in
washington
dc
and
beck
was
never
able
to
recover
them
it
was
disheartening
to
the
musician
who
felt
the
two
years
of
songwriting
represented
something
more
technically
complex
as
a
result
beck
took
a
break
and
wrote
no
original
compositions
in
2003[27]
feeling
as
though
it
might
take
him
a
while
to
get
back
to
that
[songwriting]
territory
he
entered
the
studio
with
dust
brothers
to
complete

dated

the

around

as

working

beck
built
a
studio
in

where
they
wrote
many
of

the
idea
was
to
get
people

together
recording
live
hitting
bad
notes

screaming
said
beck
adding
that
the
album
is
best
described
as

beck
described
the
recording
process
as
painful
noting
that
he
edited
down

constantly
and
he
perhaps
recorded

about

fifteen
years
prior

after

when

a

for

beck
decided
to
play

interested

he
aimed
to
keep
the
arrangements
as
open
as
possible
to
recreate
the
simplicity
of

became
preoccupied
with
creating
only

in
particular
pitchfork
described

nyc

as
a
fantasia

the
most
startling
and
original
piece
of
music
with

name
on

in

while
and
the

musical
style
[edit]
beck's
musical
style
has
been
considered
alternative[94]
and
indie[95]
he
has
played
many
of
the
instruments
in
his

himself[96]
beck
has
also
done
some
remixes
for

several
musical
elements
together
in

folk
psychedelia
electronic
country
latin
music
hip
hop
funk
soul
blues
and
many
types
of
rock[97]
he
has
also
taken
music
from
los
angeles
as
a
reference
point
in
his
songs[97]
beck
has
an
irreverent
style
of
sampling
often
using
such
sources
as
obscure
films
to
splice
together
cuts
of
people
talking
in
the
background
of
his
music
or
various
other
found
sounds
to
create
sound
collages
in
the
background
of
his
music[citation

beck
wonderfully
blends
prince
talking
heads
paul's
boutique
'shake
your
bonbon'
and
mathlete
on
midnite
vultures
his
most
consistent
and
playful
album
yet
the
review
continued
to
comment
on
beck
saying
that
his
mix
of
goofy
piety
and
ambiguous
intent
helped
the
album[98]
a
beck
song
called
harry
partch
a
tribute
to
the
composer
and
his
corporeal
music
employs
partch's

scale[99]

where

was
quoted
as
saying
yeah
i'm
a
scientologist
my
father
has
been
a
scientologist
for
about
35
years
so
i
grew
up
in
and
around
it
when
questioned
by
the
interviewer
about
scientology's
core
beliefs
he
replied
what
it
actually
is
is
just
sort
of
uh
you
know
i
think
it's
about
philosophy
and
sort
of
uh
all
these
kinds
of
you
know
ideals
that
are
common
to
a
lot
of
religions
there's
nothing
fantastical

just
a
real
deep
grassroots
concerted
effort
for
humanitarian
causes
i
don't
know
if
you
know
the
stuff
they
have
it's
unbelievable
the
stuff
they
are
doing
education

they
have
free
centres
all
over
the
place
for
poor
kids
they

the
number
one
drug
rehabilitation
programme
in
the
entire
world
(called
narconon)

percent
success
rate
when
you
look
at
the
actual
facts
and
not
what's
conjured
in
people's
minds
that's
all
bullshit
to
me
because
i've
actually
seen
stuff
first
hand[107]
