asserted
in

that
dr

around

finished
for
detox[87]

by

during

at

the

first

prior

release
in
an
unmixed
unmastered
form
without
a
chorus
on

2010[90]
however
critical
reaction
to
the
song
was
lukewarm
and
dr

later
announced
in

that
the

along
with
any
other
previously
leaked
tracks
from

recording
process
would
not
appear
on

the

100
and
later
being
certified
double
platinum
by

the
australian
recording
industry
association
(aria)[24][94]
the
length
of
time
that
detox
has
taken
to
record
as
well
as
the
limited
amount
of
material
that
has
been
officially
released
or
leaked
from
the

sessions
has
given
it
considerable
notoriety
within

music
industry[95]
numerous

dates
(including
the
ones
mentioned

have
been
given
for

none
of
them

closely
affiliated

dr
dre
including
snoop
dogg
fellow
rappers
50
cent
and
game
and
producer
dj
quik
have
speculated
in
interviews
that
the
album
will
never
be
released
due
to
dr
dre's
business
and
entrepreneurial
ventures
having
interfered
with
recording
work
as
well
as
causing

to
lose
motivation
to

has
said
that
his
primary
instrument
in
the
studio
is
the
akai
mpc3000
a
drum
machine
and
sampler
and
that
he
often
uses
as
many
as

five
to

a

recording
he
cites
1970s
funk
musicians
such
as
george
clinton
isaac
hayes
and
curtis
mayfield
as
his
primary
musical
influences
unlike
most
rap
producers
he
tries
to
avoid
samples
as
much
as
possible
preferring
to
have
studio
musicians
replay
pieces
of
music
he
wants
to
use
because
it
allows
him
more
flexibility
to
change
the
pieces
in
rhythm
and
tempo[120]
in
2001
he
told
time
magazine
i
may
hear
something
i
like
on
an
old
record
that
may
inspire
me
but
i'd
rather
use
musicians
to
recreate
the
sound
or
elaborate
on
it
i
can
control
it
better[121]
other
equipment
he
uses
include
the
emu
sp1200
drum
machine
and
other
keyboards
from
such
manufacturers
as
korg
rhodes
wurlitzer
moog
and
roland[122]
after
founding
aftermath
entertainment
in
1996
dr&nbspdre
took
on
producer
melman
as
a
coproducer
and
his
music
took
on
a
more
synthesizerbased
sound
using
fewer
vocal
samples
(as
he
had
used
on
lil'
ghetto
boy
and
let
me
ride
on

chronic
for
example)
melman
has
not
shared

with

approximately

credited

with
mike
elizondo
a
bassist
guitarist
and
keyboardist
who
has
also
produced
written
and
played
on
records
for
female
singers
such
as
poe
fiona
apple
and
alanis
morissette[124]
in
the
past
few
years
elizondo
has
since
worked
for
many
of
dr&nbspdre's
productions[125][126]
dr&nbspdre
also
told
scratch
magazine
in
a
2004
interview
that
he
has
been
studying
piano
and
music
theory
formally
and
that
a
major
goal
is
to
accumulate
enough
musical
theory
to
score
movies
in
the
same
interview
he
stated
that
he
has
collaborated
with
famed
1960s
songwriter
burt
bacharach
by
sending
him
hip
hop
beats
to
play
over
and
hopes
to
have
an
inperson
collaboration
with
him
in
the
future[120]
work
ethic
[edit]
dr&nbspdre
has
stated
that
he
is
a
perfectionist
and
is
known
to
pressure
the
artists
with
whom
he
records
to
give
flawless
performances[120]
in
2006
snoop
dogg
told
the
website
dubcnncom
that
dr&nbspdre
had
made
new
artist
bishop
lamont
rerecord
a
single
bar
of
vocals
107&nbsptimes[127]
dr&nbspdre
has
also
stated
that
eminem
is
a
fellow
perfectionist
and
attributes
his
success
on
aftermath
to
his
similar
work
ethic[120]
he
gives
a
lot
of
input
into
the
delivery
of
the
vocals
and
will
stop
an
mc
during
a
take
if
it
isn't
to
his
liking[128]
however
he
does
give
mcs
he
works
with
room
to
write
lyrics
without
too
much
instruction
unless
it
is
a
specifically
conceptual
record
as
noted
by
bishop
lamont
in
the
book
how
to
rap[129]
a
consequence
of
his
perfectionism
is
that
some
artists
that
initially
sign
deals
with
dr&nbspdre's
aftermath
label
never
release
albums
in
2001
aftermath
released
the
soundtrack
to
the
movie
the
wash
featuring
a
number
of
aftermath
acts
such
as
shaunta
daks
joe
beast
and
toi
to
date
none
have
released
fulllength
albums
on
aftermath
and
have
apparently
ended
their
relationships
with
the
label
and
dr&nbspdre
other
noteworthy
acts
to
leave
aftermath
without
releasing
albums
include
king

and
rakim[130]
collaborators
and
coproducers
[edit]
over
the
years
word
of
other
collaborators
who
have
contributed
to
dr&nbspdre's
work
has
surfaced
during
his
tenure
at
death
row
records
it
was
alleged
that
dr&nbspdre's
stepbrother
warren
g
and
tha
dogg
pound
member
daz
made
many
uncredited
contributions
to
songs
on
his
solo
album
the
chronic
and
snoop
doggy
dogg's
album
doggystyle
(daz
received
production
credits
on
snoop's
similarsounding
albeit
less
successful
album
tha
doggfather
after
young
left
death
row
records)[131]
it
is
known
that
scott
storch
who
has
since
gone
on
to
become
a
successful
producer
in
his
own
right
contributed
to
dr&nbspdre's
second
album
2001
storch
is
credited
as
a
songwriter
on
several
songs
and
played
keyboards
on
several
tracks
in
2006
he
told
rolling
stone
at
the
time
i
saw
dr&nbspdre
desperately
needed
something
storch
says
he
needed
a
fuel
injection
and
dr&nbspdre
utilized
me
as
the
nitrous
oxide
he
threw
me
into
the
mix
and
i
sort
of
tapped
on
a
new
flavor
with
my
whole
piano
sound
and
the
strings
and
orchestration
so
i'd
be
on
the
keyboards
and
mike
[elizondo]
was
on
the
bass
guitar
and
dr&nbspdre
was
on
the
drum
machine[132]
current
collaborator
mike
elizondo
when
speaking
about
his
work
with
young
describes
their
recording
process
as
a
collaborative
effort
involving
several
musicians
in
2004
he
claimed
to
songwriter
universe
magazine
that
he
had
written
the
foundations
of
the
hit
eminem
song
the
real
slim
shady
stating
i
initially
played
a
bass
line
on
the
song
and
dr&nbspdre
tommy
coster
jr
and
i
built
the
track
from
there
eminem
then
heard
the
track
and
he
wrote
the
rap
to
it[126]
this
account
is
essentially
confirmed
by
eminem
in
his
book
angry
blonde
stating
that
the
tune
for
the
song
was
composed
by
a
studio
bassist
and
keyboardist
while
dr&nbspdre
was
out
of
the
studio
but
young
later
programmed
the
song's
beat
after
returning[133]
a
group
of
disgruntled
former
associates
of
dr&nbspdre
complained
that
they
had
not
received
their
full
due
for
work
on
the
label
in
the
september
2003
issue
of
the
source
a
producer
named
neffu
claimed
to
have
produced
the
songs
say
what
you
say
and
my
dad's
gone
crazy
on
the
eminem
show
the
songs
if
i
can't
and
back
down
on
50
cent's
get
rich
or
die
tryin'
and
the
beat
featured
on
dr&nbspdre's
commercial
for
coors
beer[130]
although
young
studies
piano
and
musical
theory
he
serves
as
more
of
a
conductor
than
a
musician
himself
as
josh
tyrangiel
of
time
magazine
has
noted
every
dre
track
begins
the
same
way
with
dre
behind
a
drum
machine
in
a
room
full
of
trusted
musicians
(they
carry
beepers
when
he
wants
to
work
they
work)
he'll
program
a
beat
then
ask
the
musicians
to
play
along
when
dre
hears
something
he
likes
he
isolates
the
player
and
tells
him
how
to
refine
the
sound
my
greatest
talent
dre
says
is
knowing
exactly
what
i
want
to
hear[121]
although
snoop
dogg
retains
working
relationships
with
warren
g
and
daz
who
are
alleged
to
be
uncredited
contributors
on
the
hit
albums
the
chronic
and
doggystyle
he
states
that
dr&nbspdre
is
capable
of
making
beats
without
the
help
of
collaborators
and
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
success
of
his
numerous
albums[134]
dr&nbspdre's
prominent
studio
collaborators
including
scott
storch
elizondo
mark
batson
and
dawaun
parker
have
shared
cowriting
instrumental
and
more
recently
coproduction
credits
on
the
songs
where
he
is
credited
as
the
producer
ghostwriters
[edit]
it
is
acknowledged
that
most
of
dr&nbspdre's
raps
are
written
for
him
by
others
though
he
retains
ultimate
control
over
his
lyrics
and
the
themes
of
his
songs[135]
as
aftermath
producer
mahogany
told
scratch
it's
like
a
class
room
in
[the
booth]
he'll
have
three
writers
in
there
they'll
bring
in
something
he'll
recite
it
then
he'll
say
'change
this
line
change
this
word'
like
he's
grading
papers[136]
as
seen
in
the
credits
for
tracks
young
has
appeared
on
there
are
often
multiple
people
who
contribute
to
his
songs
(although
often
in
hip
hop
many
people
are
officially
credited
as
a
writer
for
a
song
even
the
producer)
in
the
book
how
to
rap
rbx
explains
that
writing
the
chronic
was
a
team
effort[135]
and
details
how
he
ghostwrote
let
me

for

to
ghostwriting
