franz
ferdinand
is
an
unrelentingly
smart
fluffy
and
fun
debut
this
scottish
fourpiece
plays
vaguely
angular
guitarheavy
postpop
that
makes
you
want
to
dance
around
the
room
while
playing
air
guitar
it's
the
ideal
hipster
guiltypleasure
music
this
is
what
the
rapture
and
interpol
would
sound
like
if
they
wrote
songs
half
as
good
as
those
they
rip
off
or
the
strokes
if
their
parents
had
sent
them
to
art
school
instead
of
the
fashion
academy
every
song
on
here
is
so
blatantly
derivative
it
sounds
almost
original
like
a
blur
without
the
gloomy
hangover
it's
too
early
yet
to
tell
if
this
is
just
a
band
for
the
moment
or
one
for
the
agesbut
who
really
cares
with
pop
music
anyway?
songs
like
darts
of
pleasure
come
on
home
take
me
out
and
cheating
on
you
are
so
good
they
will
surely
appeal
even
to
those
without
slanty
messy

by
that
one
guy
formataudio
cd
first
off
i'll
start
out
with
the
obligitory
fair
warning
you'll
hear
franz
compared
to
almost
every
band
that
has
had
some
success
in
the
past
2
yearseveryone
from
the
strokes
to
interpol
and
beyond
truth
is
although
franz
ferdinand
pays
an
agreeable
nod
to
a
few
bands
that
have
come
before
them
they
have
developed
their
own
unique
sound
and
comparisons
will
undoubtedly
fall
short
the
best
way
to
judge
would
be
for
you
to
see
what
kinds
of
music
i
really
like
if
you
like
these
bands
too
you'll
thank
me
for
suggesting
franz
ferdinand
i'm
kind
of
bummed
that
the
album
finally
came
out
in
the
statesi
imported
a
copy
after
hearing
a
download
from
the
bands
website
a
few
months
back
here's
to
hoping
that
the
band
doesn't
attract
so
much
attention
that
their
reputation
preceeds
their
musical
prowess
i
love
the
smiths
first
and
foremosti
think
they're
one
of
the
best
bands
that
ever
came
together
to
record
music
i
like
the
cure
i
like
gang
of
four
neutral
milk
hotel
and
my
bloody
valentine
in
recent
years
i
like
interpol
and
i
like
the
rapture
and
even
hot
hot
heat
the
boys
from
ff
hail
from
glasgow
a
town
that
has
brought
us
the
creative
and
musical
genius
that
is
belle
and
sebastian
i
don't
know
what's
in
the
water
over
there
but
i'm
considering
importing
some
of
it
franz
ferdinand
come
out
on
their
debut
album
as
a
group
of
artists
formed
not
for
the
sole
purpose
of
creating
music
but
creating
an
atmosphere
and
a
feeling
fortunately
for
us
the
guys
just
happen
to
be
topnotch
musicians
and
they've
put
together
some
of
the
best
songs
to
come
out
in
the
past
6
years
poppy?
some
of
it
yesbut
not
questionably
so
amazing
bass
lines
great
high
hat
attacks
and
solid
rhythm
guitar
lay
down
the
backdrop
for
a
painting
that
could
only
be
completed
by
a
soulfull
solid
voice
there
will
be
the
inevitible
comparisons
to
pulp
interpol
joy
division
etc
but
none
of
them
really
fit
the
bill
this
album
has
an
overall
feeling
of
coming
from
the
smiths'
era
but
not
necessarliy
a
retro
feel
just
as
everything
adds
up
to
be
more
than
the
simple
sum
of
its'
parts
franz
ferdinand
is
a
unique
combination
of
artists
and
musicians
that
seem
to
have
come
together
for
the
perfect
approach
to
inspired
clever
lyrics
and
an
original
sound
that's
righti
said
it
orginal
every
band
is
influenced
by
other
bandsit's
how
they
take
that
inspiration
and
use
it
to
their
own
advantage
that
sets
bands
miles
apart
these
guys
are
for
realand
if
you're
a
fan
of
good
music
that
entirely
eclipses
what
you
hear
on
the
radio
in
this
day
and
age
pick
it
up
and
then
email
me
for
an
address
so
that
you
can
send
me
a
thank
you
card
pick
it
up
now
before
they
end
up
on
the
cover
of
rolling
stone
as
the
band
slated
to
save
rock
and
roll
then
you
can
laugh
at
people
who
start
to
listen
to
them
in
july
and
say
'my
boys
from
glasgow!
i've
been
listening
to
them
for
like
forever!'
either
way
get
it
now

50
out

5
stars
a
unique
and
strong
debut!
july
30
2004
by
busy
body
formataudio
cd
when
they
released
their
selftitled
debut
album
in
the
uk
in
january
2004
franz
ferdinand
were
hailed
as
the
first
great
new
band
of
the
year
unbelievable
hype
swirled
around
the
new
scottish
fourpiece
as
they
burst
into
the
charts
with
their
unmistakable
debut
their
debut
single
garnered
many
pleasing
reviews
and
made
the
band
one
of
the
most
talked
about
of
the
year
with
heavyguitars
and
loveable
beats
this
is
essentially
postpop
melodic
fun
with
hints
of
rock
from
the
punk
scene

all
mashed
together
in
a
rebellious
yet
funloving
way
the
album
itself
doesn't
even
manage
to
make
the
40
minute
mark
clocking
in
at
3849
yet
with
this
album
it
is
definitely
more
quality
over
quantity
franz
ferdinand
have
made
an
impact
because
they
are
different
from
anything
else
out
there
their
beats
are
repetitive
yes
and
their
lyrics
are
simplistic
but
it's
the
way
the
band
are
'marketed'
and
i
use
that
word
lightly
because
they
are
definitely
not
a
manufactured
band
they're
outrageously
camp
eccentric
and
very
geeky

the
kind
of
music
you
could
imagine
the
high
school
nerds
rocking
to
but
secretly
love
yourself
the
music
is
a
revelation
and
behind
that
bland
and
boring
uninspired
black
album
cover
lies
of
a
cracking
album
just
waiting
to
jump
into
your
cd
player
the
album
opens
with
jacqueline
the
song
opens
softly
with
a
light
guitar
and
the
vocals
of
the
lead
singer
after
around
forty
seconds
the
beat
kicks
in
and
soon
begins
a
brilliant
fastpaced
rocker
with
a
definite
retro
theme
following
this
is
the
excellent
tell
her
tonight
with
david
bowielike
vocals
the
band
sing
about
a
girl
who
must
be
informed
of
something

the
'something'
is
rather
ambiguous
however
making
you
think
what
it
could
be
in
the
verses
the
band's
debut
single
is
up
next
take
me
out
which
made
it
to
no3
in
the
uk
the
song
opens
loudly
and
the
beat
soon
kicks
in
only
to
slow
down
steadily
until
the
soontobebritishanthem
bass
kicks
in
around
the
55th
second
this
is
by
far
the
greatest
footstomper
of
the
year
and
an
awesome
handclapper!
the
lyrics
are
bright
and
vibrant
as
are
the
vocals
and
the
entire
composition

absolute
masterpiece!
the
dark
of
the
matinee
is
up
next
and
was
the
second
single
to
be
taken
from
the
album
in
this
song
the
band
sing
of
meeting
a
girl
in
the
matinee
it's
very
old
fashioned
in
style
but
the
music
is
bang
up
to
date
and
fresh
find
me
and
follow
me
through
corridors
refectories
and
files
you
must
follow
leave
this
academic
factory
you
will
find
me
in
the
matinee
the
dark
of
the
matinee!
it's
better
in
the
matinee
the
dark
of
the
matinee!
it's
mine
yes
it's
mine!
the
next
song
is
auf
achse
which
is
a
great
song
with
a
brilliant
oneminute
musical
intro
before
the
singing
starts
the
song
sings
of
wanting
a
girl
bad
style
but
not
being
able
to
have
her
so
near
yet
so
far
away!
cheating
on
you
begins
like
some
60'spsychedelia
song
that
you'd
hear
in
austin
powers!
the
lyrics
are
once
again
repetitive
but
who
cares
when
you
can
nod
your
head
this
hard?!
this
fire
is
a
rather
disappointing
song
that
doesn't
quite
match
the
others
on
this
album
but
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
darts
of
pleasure
is
another
lyrically
repetitive
song
yet
it
has
a
pleasurableenough
beat
to
keep
afloat
michael
is
the
third
single
to
be
released
from
the
album
and
has
to
be
a
definite
album
highlight!
this
is
like
the
true
gay
anthem
of
the
year!
it
really
is
superbly
produced
and
very
humorous
the
boys
sing
about
michael
a
beautiful
boy
on
a
beautiful
dancefloor
he
has
leather
hips
sticky
lips
and
is
the
mostwanted
guy
to
dance
with!
the
determination
in
the
song
is
what
makes
it
so
hilarious
and
it's
good
to
see
the
band
singing
about
a
topic
that
would
make
other
socalled
'respectable'
artists
criticised
come
on
home
has
a
brilliant
and
very
catchy
beat
to
start
off
with
and
continues
this
through
the
remainder
of
the
song
the
song
is
similar
to
the
rest
on
the
album
and
it
might
be
difficult
to
distinguish
it
from
the
others
to
begin
with
yet
over
time
with
repeated
listens
you'll
grow
to
love
this
as
an
album
highlight!
the
album
closes
with
40'
which
is
a
rather
unusual
song
compared
to
the
rest
on
the
album
it
has
a
singular
beat
running
all
the
way
through
it
which
is
very
catchy
along
with
the
lalala
bit!
overall
grade
9/10
franz
ferdinand
have
certainly
created
a
unique
debut
album
here
which
has
just
picked
up
a
mercury
music
prize
nomination
in
the
uk
and
is
tipped
to
win
in
september
there
are
a
few
dull
moments
on
this
album
i
won't
lie
but
the
good
parts
far
outweigh
these
the
band
at
this
stage
in
their
careers
are
in
desperate
need
of
progression
and
development
if
they
are
to
survive
for
a
long
time
they
can't
carry
on
making
music
that
is
similar
to
this
as
i
feel
the
public
would
get
bored
and
simply
desert
them
i
look
forward
to
the
sophomore
album
as
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
they
come
up
with

cd
no
this
franz
ferdinand
is
not
a
person
rather
it
is
a
scottish
quartet
who
produced
some
of
the
most
entertaining
rocky
pop
of
the
past
year
in
their
selftitled
debut
shifting
from
uk
stardom
to
the
us
charts
as
well
it's
undeniably
a
guilty
pleasure
but
it's
also
fun
catchy
and
fairly
original
the
selftitled
album
starts
off
on
a
strong
note
with
the
bassheavy
pop
jacqueline
the
kickoff
to
a
slew
of
rocktinged
songs
(the
catchy
heavy
take
me
out
the
slithery
darts
of
pleasure)
vaguely
arty
pop
(the
addictive
the
dark
of
the
matinee)
before
finishing
off
with
the
quirky
percussion
riffs
and
la
la
las
of
40'
there
is
also
a
bonus
cd
which
has
a
few
songs
tacked
in
from
their
darts
of
pleasure
ep
among
the
stuff
on
this
bonus
disc
is
a
lowkey
remix
of
this
fire
the
overwrought
shopping
for
blood
and
the
geekily
gleeful
glam
of
van
tango
the
demos
aren't
nearly
as
enjoyable

they're
rough
which
is
to
be
expected
but
they
are
also
slurred
and
not
catchy
one
of
the
most
pleasant
things
about
franz
ferdinand
is
the
sense
of
fun
that
permeates
the
music
it
sounds
like
a
bunch
of
lads
having
a
great
time
as
they
make
some
very
danceable
music
there
are
some
dud
melodies
(tell
her
tonight)
after
their
strong
opener
but
it's
all
fairly
entertaining
however
franz
ferdinand
needs
to
work
on
their
melodies

they're
pretty
entertaining
but
somewhat
repetitive
like
the
rising
and
falling
riff
in
michael
the
riff's
good
but
it
fails
to
go
anywhere
more
solid
are
the
bass
lines
and
the
thrashier
guitar
work
backed
up
some
equally
solid
percussion
and
they
have
a
great
sense
of
what
makes
a
good
poprock
tune
able
to
be
catchy
without
being
flimsy
singer/lead
vocalist
alex
kapranos
is
a
good
flexible
vocalist
he
can
swoon
and
shout
and
keeps
his
vocals
from
sinking
into
the
mire
of
thrashing
guitars
he
also
has
the
admirable
talent
of
being
able
to
shift
his
voice
to
make
it
softer
or
harder
depending
on
the
song
franz
ferdinand
needs
to
do
something
about
the
terrible
highpitched
backing
in
tell
her
tonight
though
it's
not
a
classic
by
any
stretch
but
the
rocktinged
pop
of
franz
ferdinand
is
an
entertaining
diversion
in
the
poprock
world
and
the
bonus
cd
is
just
icing
on
the
cake
