once
the
acrimonious
breakup
of
the
eagles
became
public
knowledge
in
1982
(they
had
been
inactive
since
1980)
members
of
the
band
were
free
to
pursue
various
projects
drummer
don
henley&nbspwould
go
on
to
the
most
successful
solo
career
while
his
output
may
be
sporadic
henley
has
proven
his
worth
as
a
solo
artist
selling
more
than
11
million
records
over
the
past
30
years
our
list
of
the
top
10
don
henley
songs
spans
his
solo
career
10
'taking
you
home'
from
'inside
job'
(2000)
&nbsp
&nbsp
judging
by
this
pianodriven
ballad
from
henley's
most
recent
solo
record
2000's
'inside
job'
he
has
few
qualms
settling
into
his
older
age
even
though
'taking
you
home'
was
bound
to
be
a
hit
thanks
to
its
reflective
nature
the
song's
lyrics
are
undoubtedly
some
of
the
most
personal
that
henley
has
ever
written
listen
to
'taking
you
home'
&nbsp
&nbsp
9
'sunset
grill'
from
'building
the
perfect
beast'
(1984)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
lyrics
of
'sunset
grill'
reflect
a
certain
hopelessness
but
they
also
reflect
some
eventual
optimism
as
the
song's
narrator
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
grill
is
like
home

everything
is
familiar
the
extended
outro
of
the
song
focuses
largely
around
the
synthesizer
(reportedly
arranged
by
randy
newman)
which
also
figures
rather
prominently
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
track
henley's
tendencies
to
sing
about
real
subjects
are
perfectly
exemplified
here
the
sunset
grill
is
very
much
a
real
place
housed
on
sunset
boulevard
in
california
listen
to
'sunset
grill'

'the
last
worthless
evening'
from
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
(1989)
&nbsp
&nbsp
with
his
1989
album
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
henley
wisely
chose
to
give
the
keyboards
that
figured
so
prominently
on
'building
the
perfect
beast'
a
rest
this
gives
songs
like
'the
last
worthless
evening'
considerably
more
breathing
room
for
the
muted
guitar
and
strong
vocals
listen
to
'the
last
worthless
evening'
&nbsp
&nbsp
7
'new
york
minute'
from
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
(1989)
&nbsp
&nbsp
new
york
might
be
known
to
some
as
the
city
that
never
sleeps
but
on
this
1989
hit
henley
betrays
that
notion
rather
openly
a
lush
set
of
strings
opens
the
song
and
are
featured
throughout
the
track
and
while
the
backing
vocals
are
absolutely
gorgeous
that
lushness
gives
way
to
rather
dark
lyrics
about
just
how
quickly
things
can
change
listen
to
'new
york
minute'
&nbsp
&nbsp
6
'dirty
laundry'
from
'i
can't
stand
still'
(1982)
&nbsp
&nbsp
'dirty
laundry'
is
the
only
entry
in
our
list
of
top
10
don
henley
songs
that
comes
from
his
1982
debut
solo
lp
'i
can't
stand
still'
the
song's
lyrics
offer
an
amusing
but
scathing
commentary
on
failed
aspirations
while
also
dealing
with
people's
seemingly
insatiable
appetite
for
wanting
others
to
fail
appropriately
enough
the
song
is
set
to
a
slinky
keyboard
track
that
helps
set
the
sinister
mood
listen
to
'dirty
laundry'
&nbsp
&nbsp
5
'the
heart
of
the
matter'
from
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
(1989)
&nbsp
&nbsp
cowritten
by
tom
petty's
guitarist
mike
campbell
the
byrdsian&nbspopening
guitar
chords
of
'the
heart
of
the
matter'
sound
like
a
petty
song
the
lyrics
to
the
midtempo
ballad
support
forgiveness
while
the
narrator
takes
the
opportunity
to
selfexamine
after
seeing
an
ex
with
someone
new
the
song
was
reportedly
inspired
by
reallife
events
henley
and
cowriter
jd
souther
each
found
themselves
in
similar
circumstances
around
the
time
the
song
was
written
listen
to
'the
heart
of
the
matter'
&nbsp
&nbsp
4
'not
enough
love
in
the
world'
from
'building
the
perfect
beast'
(1984)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
bulk
of
'building
the
perfect
beast'
is
centered
around
keyboards
as
lead
instrument
and
while
they
figure
into
'not
enough
love
in
the
world'
the
song
owes
more
to
oldschool
rb
than
'80s
pop
the
track
is
one
of
henley's
most
soulful
but
it
also
shows
fans
that
he
could
be
as
much
of
a
hopeless
romantic
as
the
next
guy
listen
to
'not
enough
love
in
the
world'
&nbsp
&nbsp
3
'all
she
wants
to
do
is
dance'
from
'building
the
perfect
beast'
(1984)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
keyboards
on
the
hit
'all
she
wants
to
do
is
dance'
can
be
a
little
overbearing
at
times
and
there's
a
somewhat
silly
and
predictable
rhyming
scheme
to
the
song
(not
to
mention
it
bears
many
sonic
hallmarks
of
the
era
in
which
it
was
recorded)
still
it's
one
of
henley's
hookiest
and
most
fun
songs
listen
to
'all
she
wants
to
do
is
dance'
&nbsp
&nbsp
2
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
from
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
(1989)
&nbsp
&nbsp
one
of
henley's
most
poignant
tracks
also
happens
to
be
one
of
his
strongest
musical
statements
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
packs
an
immediate
punch
written
by
henley
and
bruce
hornsby
the
song
is
as
cynical
as
it
is
hopeful
written
at
the
tail
end
of
the
reagan
era
listen
to
'the
end
of
the
innocence'
&nbsp
&nbsp
1
'the
boys
of
summer'
from
'building
the
perfect
beast'
(1984)
&nbsp
&nbsp
one
of
the
bestever
comingofage
songs
may
or
may
not
be
autobiographical
but
how
can
one
read
lyrics
like
don't
look
back
you
can
never
look
back
and
not
think
of
the
eagles
breakup?
regardless
of
meaning
'the
boys
of
summer'
helped
solidify
henley's
voice
outside
of
his
former
band
listen
to
'the
boys
of
summer'
