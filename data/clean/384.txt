a
great
time

was
above

allman
looks
like
he
still
loves
to
perform!
have
seen
him
many
times
thru
the
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed!
this
venue
is
a
good
place
to
see
a
concert
we
saw
jamey
johnson
last
year
and
he
was
also
excellent!
the
crowd
was
alittle
too
calm
for
my
taste
but
can't
fix
thati
had
a
blast!
good
show!
hopefully
he
won't
wait
too
long
for
a
return
visit!

this
performance
seemed
to
exceed
the
expectations
of
most
of
the
audience
one
never
knows
if
the
older
artists
can
continue
to
deliver
gregg
allman
clearly
still
does
additionally
it
was
surprising
to
me
how
good
the
band
members
were
as
individuals
i
also
enjoyed
the
smaller
venue
at
the
casino
the
performers
seem
to
be
able
to
connect
with
the
audience
better
in
that
enviroment
and
to
my
ear
the
sound
is
better

i've
seen
gregg
allman
dozens
of
times
since
1974
both
with
the
brothers
and
with
his
various
solo
bands
and
he
has
never
disappointed
this
concert
was
no
exception
i
have
long
believed
that
gregg
has
been
vastly
underappreciated
but
with
the
recent
success
of
his
book
and
the
low
country
blues
album
he
is
finally
receiving
the
kind
of
recognition
and
respect
he
deserves
and
he
clearly
appreciates
it
this
night
he
was
more
animated
than
usual
and
more
at
ease
which
was
nice
to
see
backed
by
a
fine
band
that
includes
longtime
members
steve
pott's
(drums)
jay
collins
(horns)
and
scott
sharrard
(guitar)
among
others
as
well
as
marc
quinonez
from
the
abb
on
percussion
and
two
additional
(locally
hired)
horn
players
gregg
put
on
a
lively
show
that
included
favorites
from
the
abb
and
his
solo
career
gregg
wielded
a
guitar
more
than
usual
which
was
cool
i've
never
seen
him
more
relaxed
and
more
satisfied
on
stage
it
was
great
to
see
and
hear
i
only
wish
i
didn't
have
to
walk
through
a
smokey
casino
to
be
there

at
the
horseshoe
casino
the
performance
was
amazing
just
enough
old
and
new
mixed
to
keep
the
concert
fresh
the
horn
section
was
amazing
my
only
issue
was
i
paid
for
floor
seats
and
was
subjected
to
a
drunken
woman
that
would
not
stay
seated
wiggling
in
front
of
me
my
boyfriend
asked
her
husband/date/man
to
please
ask
her
to
sit
down
she
would
sit
then
stand
after
a
long
period
of
standing
i
touched
his
shirt
he
just
shook
his
head
i
feel
like
security
at
bluesville
should
watch
and
keep
the
drunks
seated
or
removed

what
a
trooper
gregg
allman
is
performing
flawlessly
under
the
worst
possible
conditions
the
last
night
of
his
winter
tour
was
marred
by
an
idiotic
audience
of
drunks
and
aisle
dancing
fools
i
did
find
it
amusing
that
one
jackass
thought
he
was
going
to
get
a
handshake
from
gregory
during
a
drum
solo
and
was
just
cooly
ignored
the
audience
old
enough
to
know
better
seemed
to
think
it
was
all
about
them
and
it
was
an
embarrassment
gregory's
performance
was
perfection
dispute
obviously
feeling
puny
he
was
coughing
during
every
break
guzzling
water
and
wiping
sweat
off
his
face
often
the
long
tour
had
taken
a
toll
on
him

saw
this

as
well
and
it
was
just
as
good
or
better
love
all
those
low
country
tunes
from
his
last
album
and
he
still
kills
the
old
stuff
band
was
great
too
loved
the
horns
never
thought
about
some
of
those
songs
with
a
horn
section
great
idea
and
the
keyboardist
was
off
the
charts
great!
and
bottomline
is
that
greg
allman
is
one
of
the
coolest
dudes
on
the
planet!!!
keep
coming
back!

this
performance
was
as
good
as
any
version
of
the
gregg
allman
band
i've
ever
seen
this
version
featured
abb
member
marc
quinones
on
percussion
a
great
addition
and
3
horns
who
were
integral
to
the
sound
most
of
the
night
the
sound
mix
was
perfect
at
least
where
i
was
sitting
allman
looked
to
be
in
good
shape
a
bit
stronger
than
in
times
past
although
he
was
coughing
between
songs
and
acknowledged
a
fatigue
factor
on
this
final
night
of
his
current
leg
regardless
the
voice
was
the
best
i've
ever
heard
from
him
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
allman
may
be
on
the
verge
of
a
huge
media
explosion
there's
a
major
movie
coming
out
about
him
and
tributes
by
major
artists
he's
had
his
moments
in
the
spotlight
before
but
i
think
he's
ready
this
time
he
has
truly
reached
his
peak
i
hope
he
stays
there
a
long
time
this
was
an
outstanding
concert
but
where
was
floyd
miles?

i've
been
an
allman
brothers
fan
for
40
plus
years
greg's
solo
act
was
simply
outstanding!
his
voice
is
still
amazing
and
the
music
was
unforgettable
i've
seen
the
abb
numerous
times
over
the
years
and
gregg's
solo
performance
twice
he's
still
got
it!

this
was
a
tight
spot
on
performance
by
the
gregg
allman
band
i
was
concerned
that
after
his
health
issues
in
the
last
few
years
gregg's
voice
wouldn't
be
as
strong
absolutely
wrong!
his
voice
was
soulful
passionate
and
very
strong
great
musicianship
and
crafting
from
the
entire
band
made
this
a
memorable
evening
one
side
note
i
was
surprised
by
so
many
allman
brothers
tunes
being
included
i
expected
much
more
of
gregg's
solo
stuff
(and
i
would've
welcomed
more
of
that
too)
enough
already!
buy
your
tickets
and
go
enjoy
one
of
the
classic
voices
of
blues
rock!
