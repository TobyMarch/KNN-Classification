history
[edit]
qtip
and
phife
dawg
were
childhood
friends
who
grew
up
together
in
queens
new
york
initially
qtip
performed
as
a
solo
artist
(mc
love
child)
occasionally
teaming
up
with
muhammad
as
a
rapper/dj
duo
while
the
duo
frequently
made
demos
with
phife
(as
crush
connection)
the
sports
enthusiast
phife
was
still
courting
professional
basketball
ambitions
and
remained
somewhat
reluctant
to
become
a
full
member
of
the
group
he
only
later
relented
after
jarobi
also
joined
thus
making
the
group
a
quartet
the
group's
final
name
was
coined
in
1988
by
the
jungle
brothers
who
attended
the
same
high
school
as
qtip
and
muhammad[3]
qtip
made
two
separate
appearances
on
the
jungle
brothers'
classic
debut
album

introduced
qtip
to
de

when
he
took
him
along
to
a
studio
session
for
the
recording
of
the
remix
for
the
group's
song
buddy
produced
by
prince
paul
the
remix
of
buddy
was
to
be
an
allround
native
tongue
production
and
the
eccentric
producer
encouraged
qtip
to
contribute
to
the
record
in
early
1989
the
group
signed
a
demo
deal
with
geffen
records
and
produced
a
five
song
demo
which
included
later
album
tracks
including

of

geffen
decided
against
offering
the
group
a
fullfledged
recording
contract
and
the
group
was
granted
permission
to
shop
for
a
deal
elsewhere
while
retaining
the
geffen
financed
songs
after
receiving
lucrative
offers
for
multialbum
deals
from
a
variety
of
labels
the
group
opted
for
a
modest
deal
offered
by
jive
records
jive
records
was
then
known
as
an
independent
rap
label
that
specialized
in
and
owed
its
success
to
building
careers
of
artists
like
boogie
down
productions
and
too
short
as
well
as
an
emphasis
on
longevity

the

following
people's
instinctive

the

continued
to
gather
a
loyal

touring

appearances
such
as
on

on

1991
based
around
a
sample
from
average
white
band's
love

life
the
song
largely
established
the
now
familiar
tagteam
interplay
between
qtip
and
phife
as
until
then
most
of
the
group's
songs
had
only
featured
vocals
by
qtip
the
two
mcs
began
to
focus
on
a
range
of
social
issues
from
date
rape
(the
infamous
date
rape)
to
consumerism
(skypager)
the
songs
were
noticeably

included

by
now
the
group
had
mastered
their
pursuits
of
rare
records
from
which
to
sample
or
gain
ideas
and
inspiration
their
innovative
sampling
layering
and
structuring
of
jazz
records
led
many
critics
to
label
their
style
as
jazz
rap
–
a
term
which
qtip
disapproved
of
as
although
he
felt
it
described
groups
such
as
stetsasonic
quite
well
it
misinterpreted

who
(aside
from
the

did
not

most
of
their
songs

jazz

to

of
the
most
memorable
of
which
is

recreated
it
in
contrast
to
most
of
the
hip

albums
released
in
the
early
90s
which
featured
rough
beats
that
run
at
relatively
fast
tempos

for
the

handled
by

interrupting

the
misunderstanding
resulted
in

in

sustained

during

of

he
wore

upon
many
of
the
ideas

although
the
results
were

had
been
an

down

asks

rev
can't
define
the
music
of
our
youth
from

we
rap
about

reality
from
people
bustin'

another

deals
with
the

use

qtip
notes
the

purpose
of

subsequently
emphasizes

says
it

other
niggas
in

think
its
crummy
but
i
don't
neither
does
the

we

it
goes

the
one
for
second
single
electric
relaxation
which
was
shot
in
black
and
white
and
takes
place
mostly
in
a
diner
the
song
was
the
cause
of
an
amusing
mystery
as
few
people
were
certain
of
what
is
said
during
the
hook
which
is
more
or
less
mumbled
out
by
qtip
(although
there
is
now
a
consensus
that
the
words
are
relax
yourself

please
settle
down)
the
third
single
to
be
released
was
oh

the
video
for
which
showed
the

in

neighborhood
setting

had

the

cited
their
frustration
with

as

significant
factor
in

phife
i
felt

i
was
happy

it

me
a
minute
to
latch
on
to
the
business
side
of
things
'cause
it
was
just
a
happygolucky
time
and
then
eventually
as

went

it
started
to
slap
me
in

as
far
as

whoever
they're
not
gonna
do
us
right
as

i
really
have
no
comment

the

was
preceded
by
the
funspirited

memorable
for
its
swirly
otherworldly

and
catchy
staccato
hook
it
also
received
a
stylish
paul

music
video
(the
last
video
the
group
ever
made)
musically
the
somewhat
somber
tone
of
the
previous
album
was
largely
absent
and
replaced
by
a
familiar
carefree
optimism
tracks
like
give
me
with
noreaga
exemplify
the
group's
approach
for
much
of
the
album
driven
by
a
pulsing
beat
the
opening
song
start
it
up
was
perhaps
even
more
minimal
than
anything
found
on
the
low

likewise
against
the
world
relies
on
little
more
than
crisply
mixed
down
drums
and
a
two
note
bassline
the
theme
of
the
album
was
firmly
focused
around
the
topic
of
love
love
for
oneself
love
for
another
love
for
mankind
love
in
the
face
of
hate
critical
reception
for
the
love
movement
was
fairly
positive
although
some
factions
viewed
the
album
as
too
subtle
to
be
thoroughly
effective
rolling
stone
for

remarked
that
the
mature
accomplished
niceness
of
the

that
the

still
have
the
skills

they're
just
short

to
hold
on

we

it'd
be

being
in

studio
it
would
be
real
interesting
to
see
where
qtip
is
it
would
all
be
on
a
much
higher
level
but
we
are
all
into
such
different
stuff
from
way
back
then
we’d
need
at
least
a
solid
month
to
work
on
something
trying
to
get
all
of
us
together
for
that
much
time…
