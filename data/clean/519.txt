jamie
o'neal
(official)
shiver
is
jamie
o'neal's
debut
album
it
may
be
our
first
listen
to
her
as
an
artist
but
it's
not
the
first
as
a
songwriter
o'neal
has
written
songs
that
were
recorded
by
leann
rimes
chely
wright
and
tammy
cochran
she's
also
recorded
background
vocals
on
records
by
mindy
mccready
clay
davidson
jason
sellers
chely
wright
ronnie
milsap
sonya
issacs
and
others
prior
to
her
moving
to
nashville
to
pursue
a
career
in
country
music
jamie
toured
with
australian
popsinger
kylie
minogue
all
over
the
world
for
two
years
this
album
is
an
eclectic
mix
of
songs
some
are
power
ballads
some
are
bluesy
some
are
even
somewhat
gospellike
but
jamie
does
each
style
well
and
the
album
definitely
works
jamie's
voice
reminds
me
of
a
young
faith
hill
she
has
a
breathy
quality
to
her
voice
but
it's
also
powerful
like
martina
mcbride
she's
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
the
album
consists
of
thirteen
songs
nine
of
which
she
cowrote
not
bad
for
a
debut
album!
the
album
starts
out
with
the
upbeat
when
i
think
about
angels
which
gets
you
singing
along
quickly
this
song
has
single
written
all
over
it
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
followup
to
there
is
no
arizona
the
first
single
there
is
no
arizona
tells
in
haunting
vocals
about
the
difficulty
at
believing
that
all
you've
been
told
were
just
lies
as
i
write
this
review
this
song
is
moving
up
the
billboard
hot
country
singles
charts
currently
at
16
where
we
belong
is
another
wonderful
ballad
not
to
be
confused
with
the
bob
segar
song
in
no
more
protecting
my
heart
you
may
be
reminded
of
taylor
dayne's
tell
it
to
my
heart
the
next
song
she
hasn't
heard
it
yet
is
about
a
woman
that
refuses
to
hear
that
her
relationship
is
over
another
upbeat
number
you
rescued
me
talks
about
thinking
there
is
no
love
out
there
for
you
and
you
are
presently
surprised
the
title
track
shiver
starts
with
a
great
steel
guitar
intro
and
the
ballad
is
awesome!
it
shakes
me
how
you
take
me
deeper
than
i've
ever
been
it's
to
the
core
under
my
skin
i
shiver
this
is
another
one
that
i
can
easily
see
as
a
single
the
only
thing
wrong
was
cowritten
by
richard
marx
and
jamie
sings
this
with
a
bluesy
feel
i'm
still
waiting
is
a
passionate
ballad
about
a
woman
that
keeps
waiting
for
her
lover
to
come
back
one
of
my
favorite
songs
on
the
album
has
to
be
the
duet
with
mark
wills
jamie
and
mark's
voices
blend
perfectly
and
this
ballad
is
perfect
for
both
of
them
mark
known
for
his
ballads
sings
this
to
perfection
and
jamie
is
no
slouch
in
the
ballad
department
and
sings
her
part
just
as
well
what
i
really
like
is
that
this
is
a
true
ballad
in
that
both
singers
get
equal
time
plus
on
the
chorus
they
switch
off
with
the
harmony
parts
this
is
a
single
for
sure
sanctuary
is
a
great
power
ballad!
you
are
my
sanctuary
my
beacon
in
the
night
you
opened
up
your
heart
you
let
me
walk
inside
frantic
is
great
fun!
she
likes
things
fast
and
furious
coffee
black
microwave
it
i'm
at
my
best
caffeinated
the
album
closes
with
another
love
song
to
be
with
you
for
those
of
you
who
listen
to
your
cds
on
your
cd
rom
this
album
is
an
ecd
which
includes
biography
lyrics
and
music
jamie's
video
for
there
is
no
arizona
a
screensaver

links
i'm
giving
this
album
a
4
7/8
jamie's

a
great
bunch
of
songs

i'm
sure
that
