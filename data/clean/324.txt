the
cause
was
complications
of
cancer
surgery
said
his
friend
and
fellow
songwriter
george
reneau
mr
gray
who
sang
and
wrote
songs
in
a
range
of
styles
including
rhythmandblues
country
disco
and
gospel
had
his
first
top
20
hit
in
1965
with
“the
‘in’
crowd”
an
upbeat
hymn
to
hipness
that
captured
the
social
restlessness
of
the
time
written
by
billy
page
and
based
on
an
idea
suggested
by
mr
gray
the
song
struck
a
special
chord
in
the
music
industry
and
was
performed
by
many
others
including
the
ramsey
lewis
trio
(whose
1965
instrumental
version
was
an
even
bigger
hit
than
mr
gray’s)
petula
clark
the
mamas
and
the
papas
lawrence
welk
and
the
chipmunks
management
problems
left
mr
gray
without
much
to
show
for
his
early
success
he
told
billboard
in
1974
he
said
he
received
no
royalties
for
“the
‘in’
crowd”
with
his
recording
career
stalled
he
spent
two
years
in
the
cast
of
the
los
angeles
production
of
“hair”
in
the
late
1960s
“drift
away”
was
recorded
in
1973
after
mr
gray
attempting
a
comeback
secured
a
contract
with
mca
records
he
was
teamed
with
the
songwriter
and
producer
mentor
williams
(the
brother
of
paul
williams)
who
had
produced
it
for
another
artist
with
no
success
mr
gray’s
strong
raspy
tenor
schooled
by
years
of
gospel
choir
duty
as
a
child
in
the
texas
baptist
church
where
his
grandfather
was
minister
gave
mr
williams’s
song
the
soulful
treatment
it
apparently
needed
sending
it
to
no
5
on
the
billboard
charts
that
year
and
carving
a
permanent
place
for
it
in
later
years
on
oldies
radio
while
recording
“drift
away”
he
felt
a
lot
of
pressure
mr
gray
said
in
a
1988
interview
with
the
tennessean
of
nashville
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
his
last
hit
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
career
was
in
the
balance
“i
was
pulling
my
hair
out”
he
said
mr
gray’s
early
life
is
not
well
documented
different
sources
give
the
year
of
his
birth
as
1940
1942
or
1943
though
all
agree
on
the
date
of
sept
26
his
given
name
has
been
reported
as
leonard
victor
ainsworth
and
lawrence
darrow
brown
by
all
accounts
he
was
born
into
a
sharecropper
family
outside
houston
in
brookshire
or
simonton
tex
mr
reneau
said
that
as
far
as
he
knew
mr
gray
who
never
married
was
71
and
that
his
survivors
included
a
sister
and
a
brother
no
immediate
family
member
could
be
reached
in
interviews
mr
gray
credited
his
baptist
minister
grandfather
with
sparking
his
interest
in
singing
mr
gray
left
texas
in
the
early
1960s
for

his
first
hit
“look
at
me”
in
1963
after
his
career
was
revived
by
“drift
away”
mr
gray
used
his
fame
to
help
support
political
causes
he
campaigned
for
jimmy
carter
in
his
1976
presidential
race
and
although
he
toured

australia
he
agreed
to
perform
in
south
africa
only
after
winning
a

to
his
web

mr

left
los

in
1978
and
began
writing

on
you”)
