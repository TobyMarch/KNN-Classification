[edit]
john

and
stu
cook
(all
born
in

met
at
portola
junior

california
the

began
playing
instrumentals

also
backing

an

label
in
san

that
had
released
cast
your
fate
to
the
wind
a
national
hit
for
jazz
pianist
vince
guaraldi
the
record's
success
was
the
subject
of
a
national
educational
television
special
which
prompted
budding
songwriter
john
fogerty
to
contact
the
label[6]
for
the
band's
first
release
fantasy
coowner
max
weiss
renamed
the
group
the
golliwogs
(after
the
children's
literary
character
golliwogg)
apparently
because
a
wave
of
popular
british
bands
had
similar
names[citation

band
roles
changed
during
this
period
stu
cook
switched
from
piano
to
bass
guitar
and
tom
fogerty
from
lead
vocals
to
rhythm
guitar
john
became
the
band's
lead
vocalist
and

tom
fogerty's
words
i
could
sing
but
john
had
a

early
success
1967–68
[edit]
in
1966
the
group
suffered
a
setback
when
john
fogerty
and
doug
clifford
were
drafted
into
military
service
fogerty
enlisted
in
the
army
reserve
and
clifford
in
the

in
1967
saul
zaentz
bought
fantasy
records
and
offered
the
band
a
chance
to
record
a
fulllength
album
on
the
condition
that
they
change
their
name
never
having
liked
the
golliwogs
the
four
readily
agreed
zaentz
and
the
band
agreed
to
come
up
with
ten
suggestions
each
but
he
enthusiastically
agreed
to
their
first
creedence
clearwater
revival
(ccr)
the
name's
three
elements
come
from
the
following
sources
tom
fogerty's
friend
credence
newball
whose
name
they
changed
to
form
the
word
creed
(as
in
creed)
a
television
commercial
for
olympia
beer
(clear
water)
and
the
four
members'
renewed
commitment
to
their
band
rejected
contenders
for
the
band's
name
included
muddy
rabbit
gossamer
wump
and
creedence
nuball
and
the
ruby
but
the
last
was
the
start
that
led
to
their
finalized
name[8]
by
1968
fogerty
and
clifford
had
been
discharged
from
military
service
and
all
four
members
had
quit
their
jobs
to
begin
an
intense
schedule
of
rehearsing
and
playing
fulltime
at
clubs[citation

from
the
album
suzie
q
received
substantial
airplay
in
the
san

bay
area
and
on
chicago's

of
a
1956

began
touring
and
started
work
on
their
second
album
bayou

(1969)
at
rca
studios
in
los

a

cites
this
song
as
being
the
result
of
high
spirits
on
gaining
his
discharge
from
the

the

also
featured

the

and
the
band's
emphasis
on

their
old
favorites
continued
with
night
time
is
the
right
time
ccr
continued
to
tour
incessantly
with
performances
at
the
atlanta
pop
festival
and
woodstock
their
set
was
not
included
in
the
woodstock
film
or
soundtrack
because
john
fogerty
felt
the
band's
performance
was
subpar
(several
tracks
from
the
event
were
eventually
included
in
the
1994
commemorative
box
set)
stu
cook
however
held
an
opposings
view
saying
the
performances
are
classic
ccr
and
i'm
still
amazed
by
the
number
of
people
who
don't
even
know
we
were
one
of
the
headliners
at
woodstock
'69[citation

the
band
complained
that
they
had
to
take
the
stage
at
three
in
the
morning
because
the
grateful
dead
had
jammed
so
far
past
their
scheduled
set

creedence
clearwater
revival
which
disbanded
in
1972
were
progressive
and
anachronistic
at
the
same
time
an
unapologetic
throwback
to
the
golden
era
of
rock
and
roll
they
broke
ranks
with
their
peers
on
the
progressive
psychedelic
san
francisco
scene
their
approach
was
basic
and
uncompromising
holding
true
to
the
band
members'
workingclass
origins
the
term
'roots
rock'
had
not
yet
been
invented
when
creedence
came
along
but
in
a
real
way
they
defined
it
drawing
inspiration
from
the
likes
of
little
richard
hank
williams
elvis
presley
chuck
berry
and
the
artisans
of
soul
at
motown
and

1970
john
fogerty
has
said
that
the
flip
side
was
inspired
by
the
band's
experience
at
woodstock[citation

the
speedy
travelin'
band
however
bore
enough
similarities
to
good
golly

to
warrant
a
lawsuit
by
the
song's
publisher[citation

it
was
eventually
settled
out
of

the
song
ultimately
topped

over

in
1972
after

departure
john

stu
cook
doug
clifford
the
cosmo's
factory
sessions
had
seen
the
stirrings
of
tensions
within
the
foursome
as
the
incessant
touring
and
heavy
recording
schedules
took
their
toll[citation

john
fogerty
had
taken
complete
control
of
the
group
in
matters
of
both
business
and
artistic
output
to
the
chagrin
of
tom
fogerty
cook
and
clifford
fogerty
resisted
feeling
that
a
democratic
process
would
threaten
their
success[citation

other
issues
included
fogerty's
decision
at
a
1970
nebraska
gig
that
the
band
would
no
longer
give
encores
at
its
live

john

included

on
many
of

notably

in
recognition
of
the
deep
respect
and
influence
of

t
and
the
mg's
with
whom
the
members
of
the
band
had
jammed
the
single's
flip
side
hey
tonight
was
also
a
hit
tom
fogerty
decided
he
had
had
enough
of
his
younger
brother
and
resigned
from
ccr
in
late
1970
during
the
recording
of
pendulum
his
departure
was
made
public
the
following
february
at
first
the
remaining
members
considered
replacing
tom
but
ultimately
continued
as
a
trio
tom
fogerty
later
stated
on
an
australian
television
broadcast
that
no
new
member
could
endure
being
in
ccr[citation

in
spring
1971
john
fogerty
did
an
aboutface
and
informed
cook
and
clifford
that
ccr
would
continue
only
by
adopting
a
democratic
approach
each
member
would
now
write
and
perform
his
own
material
fogerty
also
would
contribute
only
rhythm
guitar
to
his
bandmates'
songs
cook
and
clifford
who
had
wanted
more
input
in
ccr's
artistic
and
business
decisions
resisted
this
arrangement
fogerty
insisted
they
accept
the
new
arrangement
or
he
would
quit
the
band
despite
the
dissension
the
trio
put
its
new
work
ethic
to
the
test
in
the
studio
releasing
the
top
10
single
sweet
hitchhiker
in
july
1971
backed
with
stu
cook's
door
to
door
the
band
toured
both
the
us
and
europe
that
summer
and
autumn
with
cook's
song
a
part
of
the
live
set
in
spite
of
their
continuing
commercial
success
however
relations
among
the
three
had
become
increasingly
strained
the
band's
final
album
mardi
gras
was
released
in
april
1972
featuring
songs
written
by
fogerty
cook
and
clifford
and
a
cover
of
hello
mary
lou
(a
song
gene
pitney
originally
wrote
for
ricky
nelson)
the
album
was
a
critical
failure
with
rolling
stone
reviewer
jon
landau
deeming
it
the
worst
album
i
have
ever
heard
from
a
major
rock
band[14]
the
sales
of
mardi
gras
were
weaker
than
those
of
the
previous
albums
ultimately
peaking
at
no&nbsp12
fogerty's
someday
never
comes
backed
with
clifford's
tearin'
up
the
country
also
cracked
the
us
top
40
the
album
was
also
notable
for
featuring
songs
written
by
all
three
members
of
the
band
with
the
writer
also
singing
their
song
the
album
had
a
disjointed
feel
with
only
the
fogertyauthored
songs
having
the
identifiable
ccr
sound
by
this
point
fogerty
was
not
only
at
direct
odds
with
his
bandmates
but
had
also
come
to
see
the
group's
relationship
with
fantasy
records
as
onerous
feeling
that
label
owner
saul
zaentz
had
reneged
on
his
promise
to
give
the
band
a
better
contract
cook
—
who
held
a
degree
in
business
—
claimed
that
because
of
poor
judgment
on
fogerty's
part
ccr
had
to
abide
by
the
worst
record
deal
of
any

embarked

however
on

1972
–
less
than
six
months
after

ended
–
fantasy

and

officially
announced
the

of

eventually

john
fogerty
later
commented
on
the
demise
of
ccr
in
a
1997
swedish
magazine
i
was
alone
when
i
made
that
[creedence]
music
i
was
alone
when
i
made
the
arrangements
i
was
alone
when
i
added
background
vocals
guitars
and
some
other
stuff
i
was
alone
when
i
produced
and
mixed
the
albums
the
other
guys
showed
up
only
for
rehearsals
and
the
days
we
made
the
actual
recordings
for
me
creedence
was
like
sitting
on
a
time
bomb
we'd
had
decent
successes
with
our
cover
of
'suzie
q'
and
with
the
first
album
when
we
went
into
the
studio
to
cut
'proud
mary'
it
was
the
first
time
we
were
in
a
real
hollywood
studio
rca's
los
angeles
studio
and
the
problems
started
immediately
the
other
guys
in
the
band
insisted
on
writing
songs
for
the
new
album
they
had
opinions
on
the
arrangements
they
wanted
to
sing
they
went
as
far
as
adding
background
vocals
to
'proud
mary'
and
it
sounded
awful
they
used
tambourines
and
it
sounded
no
better
that's
when
i
understood
i
had
a
choice
to
make
at
that
point
in
time
we
were
just
a
one
hit
wonder
and
'suzie
q'
hadn't
really
been
that
big
a
hit
either
this
[the
new
album]
would
be
a
success
something
really
big
or
we
might
as
well
start
working
at
the
car
wash
again
there
was
a
big
row
we
went
to
an
italian
restaurant
and
i
remember
that
i
very
clearly
told
the
others
that
i
for
one
didn't
want
to
go
back
to
the
car
wash
again
now
we
had
to
make
the
best
possible
album
and
it
wasn't
important
who
did
what
as
long
as
the
result
was
the
very
best
we
could
achieve
and
of
course
i
was
the
one
who
should
do
it
i
don't
think
the
others
really
understood
what
i
meant
but
at
least
i
could
manage
the
situation
the
way
i
wanted
the
result
was
eight
millionselling
doublesided
singles
in
a
row
and
six
albums
all
of
which
went
platinum
and
melody
maker
had
us
as
the
best
band
in
the
world
that
was
after
the
beatles
split
but
still
and
i
was
the
one
who
had
created
all
this
despite
that
i
don't
think
they
understood
what
i
was
talking
about
they
were
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
more
control
and
more
influence
so
finally
the
bomb
exploded
and
we
never
worked
together
again[16]

john
fogerty
performing
in
2011
in
1973
fogerty
began
his
solo
career
with
the
blue
ridge
rangers
his
oneman
band
collection
of
country
and
gospel
songs
under
his
old
ccr
contract
however
fogerty
owed
fantasy
eight
more
records
in
the
end
he
refused
to
work
for
the
label
the
impasse
was
resolved
only
when
asylum
records'
david
geffen
bought
fogerty's
contract
for
$1000000
his
next
major
hit
was
centerfield
a
charttopping
success
in
1985
on
tour
in
1986
however
fogerty
suffered
complaints
over
his
steadfast
refusal
to
perform
ccr
songs
and
suffered
with
recurring
vocal
problems
which
he
blamed
on
having
to
testify
in
court
fogerty's
explanation
for
not
playing
ccr
material
songs
was
that
he
would
have
had
to
pay
performance
royalties
to
copyright
holder
saul
zaentz
and
that
it
was
too
painful
to
revisit
the
music
of
his
past
with
the
centerfield
album
fogerty
also
found
himself
entangled
in
new
titfortat
lawsuits
with
zaentz
over
the
song
the
old
man
down
the
road
which
was
according
to
zaentz
a
blatant
rewrite
of
fogerty's
own
1970
ccr
hit
run
through
the
jungle
since
fogerty
had
traded
his
rights
to
ccr's
songs
in
1980
to
cancel
his
remaining
contractual
obligations
fantasy
now
owned
the
rights
to
run
through
the
jungle
and
sued
fogerty
essentially
for
plagiarizing
himself
while
a
jury
ruled
in
fogerty's
favor
he
did
settle
a
defamation
suit
filed
by
zaentz
over
the
songs
mr
greed
and
zanz
kant
danz
fogerty
was
forced
to
edit
the
recording
changing
the
zanz
reference
to
vanz
on
february
19
1987
at
the
palomino
club
in
los
angeles
fogerty
broke
his
selfimposed
1972
ban
on
performing
ccr
hits
on
an
admonition
from
bob
dylan
and
george
harrison
(who
both
joined
him
onstage)
that
if
you
don't
the
whole
world's
gonna
think
'proud
mary'
is
tina
turner's
song
at
a
1987
independence
day
benefit
concert
for
vietnam
war
fogerty
finally
ran
through
the
list
of
ccr
hits
beginning
with
born
on
the
bayou
and
ending
with
proud
mary
he
retreated
from
music
again
in
the
late
1980s
but
returned
in
1997
with
the
grammywinning
blue
moon
swamp
fogerty
still
tours
frequently
and
performs
ccr
classics
alongside

reunions
[edit]

rarely
reunited
after

all
four
members
jammed
together
at
tom

wedding
on
october
19
1980
john
fogerty
cook
and
clifford
played
at
their
20th
el
cerrito
high
school
reunion
in
1983
but
as
their
original
incarnation
the
blue
velvets
in
the
1980s
and
90s
new
rounds
of
lawsuits
between
the
band
members
as
well
as
against
their
former
management
deepened
their
animosities
by
the
time
ccr
was
inducted
into
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
in
1993
john
fogerty
refused
to
perform
with
cook
and
clifford
the
pair
were
barred
from
the
stage
while
fogerty
played
with
an
allstar
band
that
included
bruce
springsteen
and
robbie
robertson
tom
fogerty's
widow
tricia
had
expected
a
creedence
reunion
and
even
brought
the
urn
containing
her
husband's
ashes
to
the
ceremony
in
a
july
2011
interview
with
the
calgary
herald
john
fogerty
admitted
that
he
would
at
least
be
willing
to
consider
reuniting
with
cook
and
clifford
years
ago
i
looked
at
people
and
i
was
so
full
of
some
sort
of
emotion
and
i'd
say
'absolutely
not!'

but
i
have
to
admit
people
have
asked
me
more
recently
and
even
though
i
have
no
idea
how
such
a
series
of
events
would
come
to
pass
i
can
tell
that
there
isn't
the
bombast
in
my
voice
in
the
denial
in
the
refusal
it's
more
like
'well
i
dunno'
never
say
never
is
i
guess
is
what
people
tell
you
in
this
life
all
kinds
of
strange
things
come
to
pass
realizing
that
it
doesn't
really
kick
up
a
big
firestorm
of
emotion
it
kind
of
suggests
that
at
least
if
someone
started
talking
i'd
sit
still
long
enough
to
listen[19]
when
asked
again
in
october
2011
about
the
prospect
of
a
reunion
fogerty
said
i'm
saying
it's
possible
yeah
i
think
the
call
[laughs]
would
maybe
have
to
come
from
outside
the
realm
somebody
would
have
to
get
me
to
look
at
things
in
a
fresh
way[20]
however
cook
and
clifford
both
stated
in
the
february
2012
edition
of
uncut
magazine
that
they
are
not
interested
in
a
ccr
reunion
leopards
don't
change
their
spots
this
is
just
an
imagepolishing
exercise
by
john
my
phone
certainly
hasn't
rung
cook
said
added
clifford
it
might
have
been
a
nice
idea
20
years
ago
but
it's
too
late[19]
in
may
2013
fogerty
once
again
said
he
would
be
open
to
a
reunion
but
he
does
not
see
cook
and
clifford
being
willing
to
change
their
stance
he
told
charlie
rose
on
cbs
this
morning
from
time
to
time
i'll
say
something
and
it'll
get
in
print
that
maybe
that
will
happen
and
then
immediately
i'll
hear
back
stuff
that
doesn't
sound
like
it's
possible

i
think
it's
a
possibility
in
the
future
you
know
it's
not
something
i'm
actively
seeking
but
i'm
not
totally
against
the
idea
either
[21]
legal
rights
[edit]
ccr's
catalogue
of
songs
has
frequently
been
used
or
referenced
in
popular
culture
partly
because
john
fogerty
long
ago
signed
away
legal
control
of
his
old
recordings
to
creedence's
record
label
fantasy
records[22][23]
fogerty
objected
to
what
he
regarded
as
a
misuse
of
his
music
in
an
npr
interview
folks
will
remember
forrest
gump
and
that
was
a
great
movie
but
they
don't
remember
all
the
really
poor
movies
that
fantasy
records
stuck
creedence
music
into
car
commercials
tire
commercials
i'm
remembering
a
paint
thinner
ad
at
one
point
the
song
who'll
stop
the
rain
oh
boy
that's
clever
isn't
it?[24]
of
particular
interest
was
the
use
of
his
protest
song
fortunate
son
in
a
blue
jean
commercial[22]
in
this
case
the
advertiser
eventually
stopped
using
the
song
as
fogerty
related
in
a
later
interview
yes
the
people
that
owned
fantasy
records
also
owned
all
my
early
songs
and
they
would
do
all
kinds
of
stuff
i
really
hated
in
a
commercial
way
with
my
songs

then
one
day
somebody
from
the
la
times
actually
bothered
to
call
me
up
and
ask
me
how
i
felt
and
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
talk
about
it
and
i
said
i'm
very
much
against
my
song
being
used
to
sell
pants

so
my
position
got
stated
very
well
in
the
newspaper
and
lo
and
behold
wrangler
to
their
credit
said
'wow
even
though
we
made
our
agreement
with
the
publisher
the
owner
of
the
song
we
can
see
now
that
john
fogerty
really
hates
the
idea'
so
they
stopped
doing
it[25]
