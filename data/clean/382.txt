et
the
allman
brothers
band&nbsphave
suffered
one
of
the
more
devastating
blows
of
their
45year
career
longtime
singerguitarist
warren
haynes
and
slide
guitarist
derek
trucks
announced
tonight
that
they
will
depart
the
band
at
the
end
of
the
year
for
25
years
and
15
years
respectively
we've
had
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
playing
living
learning
and
traveling
with
the
allman
brothers
band
one
of
the
truly
legendary
rock
and
roll
bands
the
two
musicians
wrote
in
a
joint
statement
we
will
be
forever
grateful
for
the
opportunity
and
the
experience
and
for
the
love
enthusiasm
and
support
of
the
incredible
fans
we
are
both
preparing
to
dig
even
deeper
into
our
various
creative
and
musical
endeavors
and
as
a
result
2014
will
be
our
final
year
as
part
of
the
band
see
where
'at
fillmore
east'
ranks
on
our
500
greatest
albums
of
all
time
the
news
comes
as
a
complete
surprise
last
month
gregg
allman
spoke
to
rolling
stone
with
enthusiasm
about
the
future
of
the
band
both
in
the
studio
and
on
stage
spontaneous
things
still
happen
he
said
going
through
the
motions
would
be
a
real
bore
i
know
a
band
that
plays
the
same
songs
in
the
same
order
they
even
say
the
same
shit
at
the
same
time
every
night
but
no
we're
all
still
real
into
it
haynes
was
recruited
by
former
guitarist
dickey
betts
to
join
the
band
in
1989
becoming
essentially
the
band's
frontman
he
quit
in
1997
to
focus
on
his
other
band
gov't
mule
but
returned
in
2000
–
a
year
after
trucks
the
nephew
of
drummer
butch
trucks
joined
the
duo
reinjected
energy
and
soul
into
the
allmans
at
countless
marathon
gigs
i
think
the
allman
brothers
individually
and
collectively
have
found
ourselves
in
a
place
where
we
just
want
to
shake
it
up
and
not
do
what
is
expected
of
us
haynes
said
in
2012
[we
have]
a
situation
where
we
can
play
what
we
want
and
people
not
only
accept
it
but
also
actually
dig
it
it's
kind
of
amazing
trucks
formed
tedeschi
trucks
band
with
wife
susan
tedeschi
in
2010
an
ambitious
project
with
a
horn
section
and
keyboards
rolling
stone
called
2011's
revelator
a
masterpiece
and
it
won
a
grammy
i
feel
that
my
solo
project
and
the
tedeschi
trucks
band
is
where
my
future
and
creative
energy
lies
trucks
said
in
his
own
statement
the
tedeschi
trucks
band
tour
schedule
keeps
growing
and
i
feel
the
time
has
finally
come
to
focus
on
a
single
project
which
will
allow
me
to
spend
that
rare
time
off
the
road
with
my
family
and
children
it's
a
difficult
decision
to
make
and
i
don't
make
it
lightly”
see
where
the
allman
brothers
band
ranks
on
our
100
greatest
artists
but
the
decision
to
leave
the
band
to
focus
on
individual
projects
is
surprising
because
the
alllman
brothers
band
schedule
has
been
especially
light
in
recent
years
these
last
few
years
we
do
the
beacon
and
then
we
do
one
month
on
the
road
in
the
summertime
and
that's
about
it
gregg
allman
told
rolling
stone
less
than
three
weeks
ago
and
then
everybody
goes
off
to
their
own
respective
solo
bands
it's
getting
more
seldom
that
we
get
together
you
know?
it
makes
you
really
look
forward
to
it”
more
information
may
surface
by
friday
when
gregg
allman
will
be
honored
with
a
tribute
concert
friday
at
atlanta's
fox
theatre
–
which
haynes
and
trucks
are
set
to
play
the
allmans
are
also
set
to
kick
off
their
annual
run
at
