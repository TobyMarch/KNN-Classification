years
uk
born
james
shaw
was
a
student
at
a
boston
music
school
and
was
friends
with
torquil
campbell
a
vocalist
who
would
later
form
stars
and
chris
seligman
the
future
synthesizer
player
of
stars
torquil
had
plans
to
move
to
new
york
city
and
on
his
suggestion
shaw
applied
to
juilliard
music
school
and
moved
to
new
york
with
him
after
a
threeyear
education
at
the
institution
shaw
had
acquired
considerable
classical
training
but
did
not
enjoy
his
stay
and
knew
his
musical
interests
lay
elsewhere
shaw
and
torquil
returned
to
toronto
emily
haines
met
james
shaw
in
toronto
in
1997
the
two
of
them
began
dating
and
writing
songs
together
in
the
same
year
shaw
released
his
studio
album
life
on
the
clock
which
also
featured
haines
singing
on
some
songs
shaw
also
moved
to
montreal
where
haines
was
still
living
in
1998
they
selfreleased
an
ep
titled
mainstream
ep
that
contained
5
tracks
with
an
overall
downtempo
and
electronic
feel
haines
later
revealed
that
the
band
was
called
mainstream
at
the
time
the
very
first
name
that
jimmy
and
i
had
was
mainstream
we
put
out
an
ep
under
that
name[2]
metric
live
2005
a
bit
later
they
changed
the
name
to
metric[2]
according
to
emily
haines
the
name
came
from
a
song
that
jimmy
[shaw]
and
i
were
working
on
back
in
toronto
in
the
early
days
like
'97
or
'98
jimmy
had
a
song
that
involved
a
sound
he'd
programmed
into
his
keyboard
and
called
'metric'
when
we
saw
that
word
on
the
keyboard's
led
screen
it
looked
so
electro
it
had
a
no
bullshit
vibe
it
was
a
little
cold
and
standoffish
and
we're
down
with
that
it
works
for
us
some
people
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we're
from
canada

which
uses
the
metric
system
that
was
coincidental
though
at
the
time
we
were
into
arty
electronic
stuff
that
was
coming
out
of
european
countries
that
also
use
the
metric
system
but
if
we'd
wanted
to
use
a
name
that
evoked
canada
we
would've
called
ourselves
the
toques
or
something[2]
in
the
fall
of
1998
shaw
moved
back
to
new
york
city
this
time
accompanied
by
haines
campbell
and
seligman
there
they
shared
a
loft
in
the
williamsburg
section
of
brooklyn
during
their
twoyear
stay
at
the
loft
haines
and
shaw
were
erstwhile
roommates
with
future
members
of
the
yeah
yeah
yeahs
liars
and
tv
on
the
radio
in
an
interview
with
91x
fm
radio
shaw
said
that
although
this
sounded
like
an
amazing
place
to
live
they
were
broke
and
it
was
difficult
for
everyone
involved[6]
that
same
year
warner
bros
records
showed
interest
in
the
group
and
the
band
did
a
development
deal
with
them
a
producer
in
london
saw
the
potential
of
commercial
success
from
the
demos
they
recorded
in
this
period
and
offered
to
bring
metric
to
the
uk
for
a
possible
record
deal
eager
to
take
a
break
from
the
somewhat
miserable
conditions
of
the
loft
haines
and
shaw
set
off
to
london
in
early
2000
and
signed
a
publishing
deal
with
chrysalis
records
with
the
help
of
the
producer
stephen
hague
(who
had
produced
acts
like
erasure
new
order
and
the
pet
shop
boys)
metric
worked
on
a
new
batch
of
new
wave/synthpop
drum
machine
paced
songs
although
metric
already
had
a
semimainstream
appeal
they
felt
restricted
by
the
confines
of
recording
demos
and
were
eager
to
return
to
nyc
and
put
a
live
band
together
in
november
2000
they
moved
back
to
their

first
few
months
of

the
effort

a
more

sound
than
the

haines

downtempo
songs
like

(which
included
singing

by

in

reminiscent
of

an
overall
jazzy

vocalizes

synthetica
is
about
staying
home
and
wanting
to
crawl
out
of
your
skin
from
the
lack
of
external
stimulation
about
forcing
yourself
to
confront
what
you
see
in
the
mirror
when
you
finally
stand
still
long
enough
to
catch
a
reflection
about
being
able
to
identify
the
original
in
a
long
line
of
reproductions
it's
about
what
is
real
vs
what
is
artificial[20]
