(krayzie

younger
brother)
on
his
indie
label
stoney
burke
in
1993
like
so
many
aspiring
rappers
around
the
country
they
put
in
calls
to
executives
at
record
companies
hoping
to
find
someone
who
would
listen
in
hopes
of
securing
a
record
deal
the
group
was
given
an
audition
over
the
phone
receiving
an
unfulfilled
promise
from
rapper
eazye
to
call
them
back
determined
to
reach
him
they
scrounged
together
the
money
for
oneway
bus
tickets
to
los
angeles
they
left
for
a
threeday
greyhound
trek
and
spent
four
months
on
the
city
streets
putting
in
frequent
calls
to
find
him
nothing
came
of
except
the
news
that
eazye
was
in
fact
on
his
way
to
cleveland
for
a
show
diego
blak
(born
diego
hodge)
a
marketer
and
promoter
and
coexecutive
producer
of
faces
of
death
introduced
them
to
eazye
at
a
concert
he
promoted
in
cleveland
ohio
where
they
auditioned
for
him
in
his
dressing
room
and
then
traveled
back
to
los

california
after
the
show
to
seal
the
deal
on
november

1993
the
group
auditioned
backstage
for
eazye
krayzie
performed
his
verse
of
flow
motion
from
the
faces
of
death
album
and
eazy
was
impressed[4]
at
this
point
eazy
named
them
thugsnharmony
but
they
wanted
to
keep
the
bone
name
so
they
renamed
themselves

after
a
slow
start
that
saw
the
album's
success
limited
to
gangsta
rap
audiences
it
broke
through
to
the
mainstream
the
ep
marked
a
major
change
in
style
for
the
group
as
they
now
fully
embraced
the
gfunk
common
in
west
coast
hiphop
of
the
time
beats
were
supplied
by
dj
yella
rhythum
d
kenny
mccloud
and
it
was
the
group's
first
collaboration
with
newcomer
producer
dj
uneek
who
would
craft
the
group's
signature
sound
by
producing
the
majority
of
their
next
two
albums
for
over
a
year
eazye
nurtured
their
career
continuing
to
serve
as
their
executive
producer
and
teaching
them
the
business
skills
he
had
taught
himself
over
the
years
the
growing
relationship
was
cut
short
however
when
eazye
died
on
march
26
1995
from
complications
from
aids
briefly
the
young
rappers
thought
they
had
lost
everything
with
the
loss
of
their
friend
however
the
group’s
potential
was
already
apparent
and
ruthless
records
continued
to
support
them
e
1999
eternal
[edit]
in
1995
the
group's
second
album
e
1999
eternal
was

hot
rap
tracks
and
tha
crossroads
which
reached
#1
on
the
hot
100
and
hot
rap
tracks
charts
the
album
saw
bone
diversify
its
content
and
musical
style
a
considerable
portion
of
the
album's
concept
was
built
upon
violent
subject
matter
yet
bone
also
incorporated
deeper
themes
as
its
songs
dealt
with
more
spirituality
and
occult
mysticism
the
album
was
produced
by
dj
uneek
(with
coproduction
from
tony
c
and
kenny
mccloud)
e
1999
eternal
also
introduced
bone's
trademark
tracks
devoted
entirely
to
the
use
of
marijuana
the
album
name
originated
from
one
of
the
street
names
of
a
corner
(e
99th
street

st
clair)
that
was
a
familiar
hangout
to
bone
members
as
well
as
eazye's
album
eternal
e
naming
it
after
eazye's
album
was
just
another
way
of
showing
respect
and
tribute
to
the
rapper
that
helped
them
reach
heightened
success
in
the
same
year
fleshnbone
would
become
the
first
member
of
the

the
album
saw
bone
further
explore
a
wide
variety
of
subjects
and
styles
with
even
more
focus
on
god
and
family
and
an
overall
more
ambient
mellow
sound
the
group
still
incorporated
violent
lyrics
though
with
a
large
portion
of
the
album
dedicated
to
what
they
labeled
clones
who
claimed
bone
had
stolen
their
quicktongued

dampened
by
the

from
the

videos
and
large
portions
of
the

(magazine)
on

that
the
art
of
war
iii
album
was
only
an
album
featuring
layzie
bizzy
and
flesh
bone
and
that
himself
and
wish
bone
had
not
recorded
any
material
for
the
album[19]
style
and
technique
[edit]
bone's
style
can
be
described
as
melodic
yet
rapidfire
and
gangsta
their
flow
is
often
interwoven
at
a
highspeed
chopper
style
melodic
pace
or
slow
harmonic
pace
although
largely
uncredited
their
monotonous
style
of
singing
as
well
as
their
rapid
fire
rhythms
over
slowed
down
beats
has
influenced
and
pioneered
the
double
time
rhythms
in
r'n'b
that
emerged
from
the
mid90s
onward
as
showcased
in
songs
such
my
love
is
the
shhhh
by
something
for
the
people
say
my
name
by
destiny's
child
and
others
they
also
tend
to
ride
the
beat
that
they're
rapping
over
they
often
describe
their
style
as
the
flip
flop
flow
sometimes
there
are
very
few
choruses
separating
their
verses
from
one
another
in
the
beginning
circa
faces
of
death
bone
used
a
pseudojamaican
patois
delivery
with
their
trademark
style
though
they
rarely
do
this
now
bone's
subject
matter
has
both
spiritual
and
occult
undertones
(eg
hell
sent
intro
mr
ouija
mr
ouija
2
and
da
introduction)
at
first
their
subject
matter
was
almost
always
exclusively
about
violence
death
and
smoking
marijuana
today
however
their
subject
matter
includes
other
topics
such
as
urban
sociopolitical
issues
positive
messages
their
old
friend
and
mentor
eazye
and
religion
besides
minor
changes
to
subject
matter
and
sound
their
lyrical
style
elocution
and
overall
methodology
remain
intact
and
have
influenced
many
new
artists
today
who
have
picked
up
this
unique
style
