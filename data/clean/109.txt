share
this
urgent
record
store
day
update
for
uk
fans
calling
all
fans
in
the
uk
only!
we
have
just
been
informed
that
the
companies
involved
with
delivering
and
distributing
our
music
in
the
uk
have
failed
to
deliver
our
10”
limited
edition
vinyl
to
the
uk
independent
record
stores
as
previously
expected
therefore
we
wanted
to
let
you
all
know
immediately
so
you
do
not
get
bitterly
disappointed
tomorrow
morning
please
note
we
have
been
told
that
the
records
will
arrive
and
be
on
sale
at
the
original
outlets
on
monday
we
have
to
take
them
on
their
word
and
assume
this
will
indeed
be
the
case
we
are
so
pissed
off
and
disappointed
about
this
and
so
sad
that
on
record
store
day
in
the
uk
our
little
jewel
will
not
be
available
for
sale
please
accept
our
sincere
apologies
but
the
circumstances
were
way
beyond
our
control
now
you
see
why
musicians
lose
their
minds
over
the
course
of
time
and
the
music
business
just
continues
to
live
up
to
it’s
reputation

we
truly
have
been
amazed
and
moved
by
all
the
wonderful
submissions
we
received
from
our
awesome
mexican
fans
we
wish
we
could
pick
all
of
you
as
winners
but
unfortunately
we
can’t…so
for
those
who
did
not
win
we’re
working
on
something
special
for
you
instead
after
much
deliberation
we
were
able
to
pick
four
favorite
submissions
for
each
show
date
but
after
additional
deliberation
we
found
we
simply
could
not
narrow
our
favorites
down
to
one
winner
in
each
city…so
we’ll
just
have
to
stick
to
four
winners
in
monterrey
and
four
winners
in
mexico
city!
and
the
winners
are…
monterrey
carlos
moreno
claudia
gomez
narvaez
fernando
arredondo
ramirez
morani
kornbergweiss
mexico
city
lucio
avila
desiree
lucero
jonatan

these

have
each
won
a
