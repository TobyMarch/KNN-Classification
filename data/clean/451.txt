biography
though
she
didn't
begin
her
musical
career
until
relatively
late
deana
carter
managed
to
defy
conventional
expectations
and
unexpectedly
shot
to
the
top
of
the
country
charts
upon
the
release
of
her
1996
debut
did
i
shave
my
legs
for
this?
carter's
success
was
equally
unexpected
considering
that
she
didn't
quite
fit
into
the
mold
of
a
standard
female
contemporary
country
singer
melding
the
popular
appeal
of
country
chanteuses
with
folky
singer/songwriters
like
mary
chapin
carpenter
carter
racked
up
both
positive
reviews
and
healthy
sales
with

becoming
one
of
the
most
pleasant
success
stories
of
the
postgarth
brooks
generation
as
the
daughter
of
nashville
studio
guitarist
fred
carter
jr
deana
carter
grew
up
in
a
musical
environment
and
was
exposed
to
a
wide
variety
of
music
fred
played
guitar
for
a
wide
variety
of
musicians
including
willie
nelson
bob
dylan
waylon
jennings
and
simon

garfunkel
the
music
of
those
artists
would
eventually
seep
into
deana's
own
style
which
she
hadn't
yet
formed
when
she
initially
tried
to
land
a
record
contract
at
the
age
of
17
despite
her
efforts
and
her
father's
assistance
carter
wasn't
able
to
secure
a
deal
so
she
abandoned
music
to
study
nursing
at
the
university
of
tennessee
while
she
was
a
student
she
continued
to
sing
for
fun
yet
she
didn't
devote
much
energy
to
music
after
graduation
carter
worked
in
a
few
hospitals
before
deciding
to
pursue
a
musical
career
at
the
age
of
23
learning
the
guitar
for
the
first
time
deana
also
began
to
write
songs
for
several
years
she
worked
odd
jobs
as
she
continued
to
develop
her
songwriting
skills
and
sing
at
nashville
nightclubs
eventually
one
of
her
demo
tapes
made
its
way
to
willie
nelson
while
another
wound
up
in
the
offices
of
capitol
nashville
nelson
who
remembered
her
from
her
childhood
was
impressed
with
carter's
songs
and
asked
her
to
perform
at
farm
aid
vii
in
1994
she
was
the
only
female
artist
on
the
entire
bill
within
a
year
capitol
nashville

signed
deana

released

the
upper
reaches
of
the
country
charts
and
had
made
inroads
on
the
pop
charts
going
gold
in
the
process

followed
in
late
1998

her
dream
