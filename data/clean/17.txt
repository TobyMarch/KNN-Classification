@beck
initially
pegged
as
something
as
a
voice
of
a
generation
when
loser
turned
into
a
smash
crossover
success
beck
did
wind
up
crystallizing
much
of
the
postmodern
ruckus
of
the
'90s
alternative
explosion
but
in
unexpected
ways
based
in
the
underground
antifolk
and
noise
rock
worlds
beck
encompassed
all
manner
of
modern
music
drawing
in
hiphop
blues
trash
rock
pop
soul
lounge
musicpretty
much
any
found
sound
or
vinyl
dug
up
from
a
dusty
crate
blurring
boundaries
and
encapsulating
how
'90s
hipsters
looked
toward
the
future
by
foraging
through
the
past
in
another
time
beck
may
have
stayed
the
province
of
the
underground
but
he
surfaced
just
as
alternative
rock
turned
mainstream
with
his
1994
debut
mellow
gold
launching
loser
a
hit
that
crossed
over
with
the
velocity
of
a
novelty
a
notion
beck
quickly
punctured
with
a
succession
of
indie
lps
delivered
in
the
wake
of
mellow
gold
including
the
lofi
folk
of
one
foot
in
the
grave
delivered
on
the
k
imprint
but
the
album
that
truly
cemented
beck's
place
in
the
pantheon
was
1996's
odelay
a
coproduction
with
the
dust
brothers
that
touched
upon
all
of
his
obsessions
providing
a
cultural
keystone
for
the
decade
while
telegraphing
all
his
future
moves
from
the
soul
prankster
of
midnite
vultures
to
the
melancholy
troubadour
of
sea
change
fittingly
beck
came
from
a
distinctly
artistic
background
the
son
of
string
arranger/conductor
david
campbell
and
bibbe
hansen
a
regular
at
andy
warhol's
factory
whose
father
was
a
pivotal
contributor
to
the
fluxus
art
movement
adopting
the
hansen
surname
after
his
father
left
beck
grew
up
in
los
angeles
dropping
out
of
school
in
the
tenth
grade
to
play
as
a
street
busker
and
attend
poetry
slams
bashing
out
blues
and
folk
beck
wound
up
assembling
a
home
tape
called
the
banjo
story
before
departing
for
new
york
where
he
operated
on
the
margins
of
the
antifolk
scene
without
ever
breaking
into
it
he
returned
to
los
angeles
where
he
continued
to
play
clubs
eventually
gaining
the
attention
of
bong
load
records
an
independent
operated
by
tom
rothrock
and
rob
schnapf
all
parties
agreed
to
pair
beck's
fledgling
folk
with
hiphop
beats
assembled
by
producer
karl
stephenson
whose
kitchen
provided
the
studio
for
their
first
efforts
including
loser
these
tapes
remained
unreleased
as
beck
recorded
an
album's
worth
of
material
with
calvin
johnson
for
the
latter's
k
label
but
the
first
release
beck
had
was
the
flipside
single
mtv
makes
me
want
to
smoke
crack
and
sonic
enemy's
cassette
release
of
golden
feelings
but
what
really
broke
the
doors
open
was
bong
load's
12
single
of
loser
which
garnered
considerable
play
in
la
coinciding
with
increased
underground
attention
soon
beck
signed
with
geffen
striking
a
deal
that
allowed
him
to
release
on
independent
labels
one
of
these
immediately
followed

fingerpaint
released
a
10
record
a
western
harvest
field
by
moonlight
in
january
1994

before
the
geffen
debut
mellow
gold
appeared
in
march
of
1994
naturally
loser
was
the
lead
single
from
mellow
gold
and
it
turned
into
an
instant
smash
boasting
a
hook
that
worked
as
an
ironic
underground
rallying
cry
and
a
novelty
crossover
despite
many
positive
reviews
beck
worked
overtime
to
dispel
the
notion
he
was
a
novelty
quickly
releasing
two
indie
albums
in
succession
the
noiseskronk
stereopathetic
soul
manure
and
one
foot
in
the
grave
stereopathetic
made
few
waves
but
the
strippedback
folky
one
foot
in
the
grave
acted
as
a
counterbalance
to
the
gonzo
mellow
gold
illustrating
the
depths
of
his
talents
after
a
furious
1994
beck
laid
relatively
low
in
1995
touring
with
the
fifth
lollapalooza
in
between
working
on
a
new
album
with
the
production
team
the
dust
brothers
who
had
collaborated
with
the
beastie
boys
on
their
landmark
1989
paul's
boutique
the
resulting
album
odelay
appeared
in
june
1996
preceded
by
the
lanky
funky
single
where
it's
at
which
would
go
on
to
win
the
grammy
for
best
male
rock
vocal
odelay
piled
up
acclaim
and
hits

devil's
haircut
jackass
and
the
new
pollution
all
charted
around
the
world

and
the
record
went
double
platinum
becoming
a
touchstone
of
'90s
alternative
rock
an
outtake
from
the
album
deadweight
appeared
on
the
soundtrack
to
danny
boyle's
1997
film
a
life
less
ordinary
then
beck
set
to
work
on
his
next
album
with
producer
nigel
godrich
who
had
just
worked
with
radiohead
on
ok
computer
their
collaboration
originally
slated
for
an
indie
release
but
moved
to
geffen
thereby
setting
a
precedent
where
no
future
beck
lp
would
be
released
on
an
indie
(something
worked
out
in
the
courts
the
following
year)
traded
futuristic
rock

either
the
joyous
collage
of
odelay
or
the
dystopia
of
ok
computer

for
a
quiet
pulsating
psychedelic
folkrock
album
called
mutations
riding
high
on
odelay
the
album
charted
well
without
turning
out
any
major
hits
although
it
did
garner
a
grammy
for
best
alternative
music
performance
beck
took
another
abrupt
change
in
musical
direction
in
1999
with
midnite
vultures
a
garish
party
record
that
was
part
satire
and
part
salute
to
soul
and
funk
particularly
prince
reviews
were
divided
between
ecstatic
and
skeptical
but
the
album
had
some
real
hits
with
sexx
laws
and
deborah
and
in
some
ways
it
was
the
apex
of
beck's
hipster
prankster
phase
a
persona
he
shed
with
his
next
album
2002's
sea
change
recorded
in
the
wake
of
a
romantic
breakup
sea
change
was
another
godrich
production
but
it
was
gentle
and
mournful
lacking
some
of
the
gritty
underpinnings
of
mutations
yet
retaining
the
psychedelia

and
that
psychedelic
edge
was
brought
out
in
the
supporting
tour
when
beck
hired
the
flaming
lips
as
his
supporting
band
the
tour
was
well
received
but
there
were
some
tensions
as
reported
by
lips
leader
wayne
coyne
later
after
an
extended
break

the
longest
he
had
taken
between
albums
to
date

beck
returned
in
2005
with
guero
an
album
that
reunited
him
with
the
dust
brothers
and
consciously
evoked
odelay
guero
launched
a
few
hits
including
epro
and
hell
yes
and
was
followed
within
months
by
guerolito
a
remixed
version
of
the
entire
album
beck
continued
in
this
direction
the
following
year
with
the
information
but
its
nigel
godrich
production
kept
the
album
streamlined
and
emphasized
the
darker
undercurrents
in
the
songs
some
of
that
darkness
could
be
heard
on
his
eighth
album
modern
guilt
a
2008
release
produced
by
danger
mouse
marking
his
first
time
in
14
years
that
he
worked
with
a
producer
who
wasn't
the
dust
brothers
or
godrich
modern
guilt
performed
respectably

it
debuted
at
eight
on
the
us
billboard
charts
and
received
strong
reviews

but
beck
spent
the
next
several
years
relatively
quiet
in
2009
he
began
actively
pursuing
a
career
as
a
producer
collaborating
with
charlotte
gainsbourg
on
her
acclaimed
irm
album
two
years
later
he
produced
thurston
moore's
demolished
thoughts
and
mirror
traffic
by
stephen
malkmus

the
jicks
he
dipped
his
toe
back
into
solo
recording
on
the
soundtrack
to
the
2010
edgar
wright
film
scott
pilgrim
vs
the
world
but
between
2009
and
2010
much
of
his
studio
energy
was
devoted
to
his
record
club
where
he
and
a
loose
collective
of
friends
covered
classic
albums
in
their
entirety
the
albums
covered
included
the
velvet
underground

nico
the
songs
of
leonard
cohen
and
inxs'
kick
beck

2012
