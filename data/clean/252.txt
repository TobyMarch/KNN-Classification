what

this

of
music
will
forever
live
on
because
it
is
music!
something
the
wannabes
of
this

will
never
accomplish!
when
my
children
would
rather
listen
to
pink
floyd
led

bad
co
lynyrd
skynyrd
etc
instead
of
katy
(traitor)
perry
bieberbutt

lazy
gaga
etc
and
know
all
the
lyrics
its
music
that
will
forever
live
on
