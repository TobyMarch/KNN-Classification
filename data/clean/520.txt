amazoncom
now
here's
a
dilemma
jamie
o'neal
who
arrived
in
nashville
by
a
circuitous
route
that
wound
through
australia
and
las
vegas
could
forge
an
entire
career
as
a
talented
jo
dee
messina/faith
hill
clone
no
more
protecting
my
heart
sounds
exactly
like
the
kind
of
la
bubblegum
that
messina
virtually
exercises
to
in
her
videos
and
it's
impossible
not
to
conjure
the
image
of
hill
on
the
shimmering
seduction
of
shiver
but
here's
where
the
dilemma
starts
though
this
album
marks
her
debut
o'neal
is
a
fully
realized
performer
with
a
ferrari
of
a
voice
she's
also
an
arresting
and
original
songwriter
example
there
is
no
arizona
a
resonant
almost
disturbing
tale
of
broken
promises
and
love
denied
set
to
a
sultry
blues
there's
nothing
else
like
it
on
country
radio
but
chances
are
o'neal
has
lots
more
offbeat
gems
stashed
where
that
one
came
from
will
she
follow
the
road
less
traveled
or
the
guaranteed
path
to
megawatt
success?
the
next
album
tells

cd
it
would
be
too
easy
to
pass
jamie
o'neal
off
as
a
faith
hill
wannabe
true
she's
blonde
and
sexy
true
sometimes
there's
a
hint
of
the
hill
voice
in
her
delivery
but
jamie
is
a
singer
and
a
star
in
her
own
right
first
off
she's
an
excellent
songwriter
as
evidenced
in
her
hit
there
is
no
arizona
what
a
unique
refreshing
and
different
song
secondly
the
passion
and
emotion
in
jamie's
voice
does
not
sound
forced
or
insincere
she
really
sounds
like
she
means
the
things
she
sings
about
and
the
production
instrumentation
and
backup
vocals
are
superb
truly
a
great
debut
album
from
a
lady
we
should
hear
a
lot
from
in
the
future
in
addition
to
the
aforementioned
arizona
track
there
are
two
classic
songs
here
she
hasn't
heard
him
yet
and
i'm
still
waiting
these
are
great
songs
that
really
tug
at
the
heartstrings
without
being
maudlin
or
sappy
actually
the
whole
cd
shines
with
some
really
great
uptempo
numbers
ballads
and
a
very
good
duet
with
mark
wills
try
this
album
out
and
let's
get
jamie
up
where
she
belongs!

song

cd
i
truly
believe
this
song
there
is
no
arizona
may
be
the
song
of
the
year
it's
lyrics
are
haunting
and
the
music
is
addictive
the
sound
is
like
no
other
in
country
music
today
and
it
will
stop
a
person
in
their
tracks
the
first
time
they
hear
it
i
think
mrs
o'neal
is
going
to
be
a
big
hit
on
the
country
scene
because
she
brings
something
new
to
country
which
is
hard
to
do
these
days
her
sound
is
enough
in
itself
but
with
her
ability
to
create
her
own
music
she
is
here
for
good
in
my
opinion
there
really
is
only
one
more
song
on
this
cd
that
will
crack
the
top
ten
and
it
is
the
title
song
shiver
the
song
with
mark
wills
will
make
a
run
but
i
don't
think
it
will
make
it
i
enjoy
all
of
the
songs
on
the
cd
but
none
of
the
others
have
the
same
gotcha
attribute
as
arizona
the
cd
is
worth
the
money
just
to
listen
to
her
unique
sultry
voice

singing
and
speaking
a
very
cool
cd
and
a
great
new
addition
to
country
music

a

jamie

when

there

i
immediately
related
to
it
and
what
the

was
feeling

pointed
the
video
out
to
my
boyfriend
one
day
while
watching
cmt
and
he
surprised
me
with
the
cd
for
christmas
i
didn't
think
that
it
would
be
very
good
but
no
other
cd
has
occupied
my
car
computer
or
cd
player
at
home
this
is
a
constant
album
i
cannot
get
enough
of!
my
boyfriend
even
likes
the
songs
on
there
and
that
is
a
stretch
for
him
he
doesn't
particularly
like
female
singers
we
get
in
the
car
now
and
he
is
like
honey
do
you
have
that
jamie
cd
in
here?
it's
great!
look
out
faith
martina
and
the
chicks
here
comes
jamie
and
she
is
about
to
explode
into
the
country
scene
like
you
have
never
seen
before!
congrats
on
your
debut
jamie!
you
deserve
it!

cd
when
i
heard
the
single
there
is
no
arizona

i
totally
fell
in
love
with
jamie's
voice
and
style!
i
have
not
heard
a
debut
like
this
since
jo
dee
messina's
selftitled
disc
in
1996
who
would
have
known
that
australia
of
all
places
would
give
us
such
awesome
coutry
music?
artists
like
sherrie
austin
keith
urban
and
now
jamie
o'neal
my
favorite
cut
is
the
jamie
o'neal/lisa
drew/shaye
smith
penned
frantic
it
is
eerily
parallel
to
my
life
running
around
from
the
time
i
wake
up
until
the
time
i
go
to
sleep
when
i
think
about
angels
is
an
upbeat
and
uplifting
tune
about
that
special
someone
who
give
you
butterflies
i'm
still
waiting
and
she
hasn't
heard
it
yet
are
haunting
ballads
the
title
track
(which
jamie
cowrote
with
drew
and
smith
about
her
husband)
is
absolutely
incredible!!
jamie's
husband
lends
his
vocal
talent
to
back
where
we
belong
no
more
protecting
my
heart
is
a
toetapper
and
features
a
rarity
in
country
music

a
saxophone
solo!
the
combination
of
all
of
these
tunes
together
is
phenomenal
and
i
listen
to
it
beginning
to
end
over
and
over
again
and
love
it
more
everyday!
there
is
really
not
a
bad
song
on
here
jamie
is
an
awesome
performer
she
has
a
knack
for
bringing
the
songs
to
life
buy
this
disc
you
will
not
be
disappointed

jamie
is
going
to
become
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
in
music
city!

some
words
to
describe
this
album
would
be
fresh
renewing
lucrative
from
the
emotional
ballad
there
is
no
arizona
about
a
woman
who
finally
realizes
her
wanderer
is
not
coming
back
to
the
powerful
no
more
protecting
my
heart
about
a
woman
who
is
tired
of
holding
back
from
love
and
moves
forward
and
gives
into
it
all
if
you're
wanting
something
to
stimulate
your
mind
and
emotion
this
album
is
the
real
deal

cd
i
am
a
longtime
fan
of
country
music
and
can
usually
spot
a
top
40
hit
when
i
hear
it
for
the
first
time!
this
one
should
go
to
#1
by
the
3rd
time
we
heard
it
my
children
could
sing
it
and
identify
with
it!
jamie
is
an
up
and
rising
star!
easy
to
get
hooked
on
her
music!

5

but
very
very
good!
firstly
i
know
that
this
cd
has
been
around
for
a
decade
but
i
just
replaced
it

i've
always
been
surprised
that
jamie
didn't
become
a
bigger
star

the
strength
