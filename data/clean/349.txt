jeff
lynne
joined
roy
wood's
british
band
the
move
in
1970
it
was
with
the
condition
that
the
group
blend
their
basic
rock
moves
with
classical
music
in
a
nod
to
'sgt
pepper's
lonely
hearts
club
band'
after
recording
two
final
albums
with
the
move
lynne
and
wood
formed
electric
light
orchestra
realizing
lynne's
dream
of
pairing
classical
instruments
(cello
violin
french
horn
oboe
etc)
with
rock
'n'
roll
riffs
the
band's
1971
debut
is
a
clunky
attempt
to
get
some
footing
with
this
new
hybrid
by
their
fourth
album
wood
was
long
gone
and
lynne
steered
elo
away
from
the
classical
pretensions
(a
drawnout
cover
of
chuck
berry's
'roll
over
beethoven'
originals
like
'10538
overture')
and
toward
stringsassisted
rock
songs
with
huge
pop
riffs
the
tracks
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
electric
light
orchestra
songs
come
from
the
fiveyear
period
in
the
mid
to
late'70s
when
they
were
one
of
the
most
reliable
bands
on
the
planet
10
'don't
bring
me
down'
from
'discovery'
(1979)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
closing
track
on
elo's
eighth
album
is
their
highestcharting
single
in
the
us
(it
reached
no
4)
propelled
by
a
marching
drum
loop
'don't
bring
me
down'
was
the
group's
last
classic
cut
the
following
year
they
recorded
the
'xanadu'
soundtrack
with
olivia
newtonjohn
in
1981
they
made
the
snoozy
concept
album
'time'
hear
'don't
bring
me
down'
&nbsp
&nbsp
9
'turn
to
stone'
from
'out
of
the
blue'
(1977)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
opening
track
and
first
single
from
the
band's
doublealbum
opus
'out
of
the
blue'
like
every
single
cut
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
electric
light
orchestra
songs
comes
with
a
godzillasize
hook
that
stomps
over
everything
in
its
way
the
small
symphony
of
strings
that
pushes
its
way
through
the
choruses
is
a
bonus
blast
of
awesome
hear
'turn
to
stone'
&nbsp
&nbsp
8
'can't
get
it
out
of
my
head'
from
'eldorado'
(1974)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
band's
first
top
10
single
and
first
moment
of
greatness
after
three
albums
of
stilted
classicalinspired
orchestral
rock
lynne
loosened
the
reins
a
little
and
let
elo
stray
into
more
modern
melodic
territory
parts
of
'eldorado'
still
follow
some
of
the
rigid
rules
of
the
past

it's
almost
required
since
it's
a
concept
album
but
this
gorgeous
ballad
stands
out
hear
'can't
get
it
out
of
my
head'
&nbsp
&nbsp
7
'mr
blue
sky'
from
'out
of
the
blue'
(1977)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
beatlesque
'mr
blue
sky'
has
grown
in
stature
over
the
years
with
artists
as
diverse
as
rapper
common
and
indierock
singer
mayer
hawthorne
incorporating
it
into
their
songs
the
single
got
to
only
no
35
but
its
place
on
the
twolp
'out
of
the
blue'
is
pivotal
it's
the
final
part
of
side
three's
'concerto
for
a
rainy
day
suite'
plus
it's
one
of
the
bestever
uses
of
the
vocoder
in
a
'70s
song
hear
'mr
blue
sky'
&nbsp
&nbsp
6
'strange
magic'
from
'face
the
music'
(1975)
&nbsp
&nbsp
one
of
elo's
greatest
ballads
not
only
is
a
highlight
of
the
band's
first
top
10
album
it
also
marked
a
turning
point
in
their
career
after
testing
a
couple
of
commercial
pop
songs
on
the
previous
lp
(1974's
'eldorado')
the
group
jumped
into
more
radiofriendly
tracks
on
'face
the
music'
(see
no
2
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
electric
light
orchestra
songs)
this
is
one
of
the
best
hear
'strange
magic'
&nbsp
&nbsp
5
'do
ya'
from
'a
new
world
record'
(1976)
&nbsp
&nbsp
'do
ya'
was
the
move's
only
chart
single
in
the
us
(it
stalled
at
no
93
in
1971)
five
years
later
lynne
revisited
his
song
with
elo
this
time
hitting
the
top
20
unlike
many
of
the
tracks
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
electric
light
orchestra
songs
'do
ya'
keeps
the
classical
elements
to
a
minimum
the
song

one
of
the
band's
toughest
cuts

features
one
of
rock's
alltime
greatest
guitar
riffs
hear
'do
ya'
&nbsp
&nbsp

'sweet
talkin'
woman'
from
'out
of
the
blue'
(1977)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
fourth
single
from
the
band's
double
album
'out
of
the
blue'
features
the
lp's
biggest
pop
explosion
'sweet
talkin'
woman'
is
all
strings
synths
guitars
and
callandresponse
backing
vocals
before
effortlessly
gliding
into
that
oneofakind
chorus
it's
also
one
of
elo's
greatest
group
performances
hear
'sweet
talkin'
woman'
&nbsp
&nbsp

'telephone
line'
from
'a
new
world
record'
(1976)
&nbsp
&nbsp
jeff
lynne
has
written
some
terrific
hooks
over
the
years
(see
pretty
much
every
track
on
our
list
of
the
top
10
electric
light
orchestra
songs)
but
this
is
one
of
his
alltime
best
'telephone
line'
was
the
last
single
to
be
released
from
'a
new
world
record'
but
it
was
the
only
one
to
hit
the
top
10
a
futuristicsounding
song
with
a
classic
melody
hear
'telephone
line'
&nbsp
&nbsp
2
'evil
woman'
from
'face
the
music'
(1975)
&nbsp
&nbsp
elo's
breakthrough
hit
is
the
moment
where
the
band
recast
itself
from
somewhat
stuffy
art
rockers
into
a
more
playful
(and
way
funkier)
group
the
top
10
'evil
woman'
includes
the
band's
usual
mix
of
oldschool
strings
and
newschool
keyboards
but
this
time
they're
backing
a
discospiked
dancefloor
beat
that
drives
the
song
all
the
way
to
pop
glory
hear
'evil
woman'
&nbsp
&nbsp
1
'livin'
thing'
from
'a
new
world
record'
(1976)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
first
single
from
elo's
sixth
album
didn't
crack
the
top
10
(it
stopped
at
no
13)
but
it's
one
of
the
group's
most
popular
songs
it
also
features
a
little
bit
of
everything
that
made
them
great
a
stringsolo
opening
soulful
backing
vocals
synth
waves
occasionally
crashing
into
the
chorus
and
a
gigantic
hook
'livin'
thing''s
legacy
was
sealed
when
it
was
used
during
the
closing
scene
of
the
1997
movie
'boogie
nights'
when
mark
wahlberg's
porn
star
whips
out
his
monster
(prosthetic)
penis
not
sure
if
this
is
what
jeff
lynne
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
the
song
but
it's
a
perfect
moment
nonetheless
hear
'livin'
thing'
