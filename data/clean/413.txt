mark

at
the
45th
cma
awards
wednesday
nov

2011
at
the
bridgestone
arena
in
nashville
tenn
(george
walker
iv
/
the
tennessean)
mark
herndon
alabama
member
or
not?
when
the
first
pictures
of
the
reunited
country
music
hall
of
famers
alabama
started
showing
up
in
2011
fans
of
the
group
immediately
noticed
something
missing
—
or
someone
longtime
drummer
mark
herndon
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
reason
singer
randy
owen
said
is
simple
herndon
was
never
really
part
of
the
group
owen
said
the
band
hired
herndon
in
1980
when
they
needed
a
drummer
and
he
wanted
to
play
but
owen
says
that’s
all
it
was
a
job
while
herndon
was
pictured
on
every
album
was
at
every
awards
show
was
inducted
with
the
band
into
the
country
music
hall
of
fame
in
2005
and
a
photo
of
him
hung
on
the
front
of
alabama’s
fan
club
and
museum
owen
said
he
was
not
officially
a
member
of
the
band
and
there
are
other
reasons
he
wasn’t
invited
to
participate
in
the
reunion
activities
aside
from
a
dispute
over
money
that
was
a
basis
for
a
lawsuit
between
herndon
and
the
alabama
group
inc
in
2008
owen
said
herndon
and
the
other
members
didn’t
get
along
“at
the
point
of
the
tour
i
know
we
made
our
minds
up
that
we
were
never
going
to
play
with
him
again
because
of
his
attitude”
owen
said
as
far
as
why
herndon
was
included
in
every
photo
and
on
every
album
cover
owen
said
that
was
rca
nashville’s
idea
joe
galante
an
executive
at
rca
nashville
who
was
responsible
for
getting
the
band
signed
and
went
on
to
be
chairman
of
sony
music
nashville
said
he
doesn’t
remember
pressing
band
members
to
include
herndon
in
photos
but
owen
said
“they
wanted
the
four
(members)
so
they
could
compare
it
to
the
beatles
i
never
thought
anything
about
it
because
everybody
knew
mark
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
structure
with
alabama
he
didn’t
play
on
the
albums
he
was
just
on
the
stage
with
us
as
were
several
other
people
had
we
been
smart
enough
there
never
would
have
been
four
people
in
the
pictures
”
these
days
owen
said
he
has
no
idea
where
herndon
is
or
what
he’s
up
to
but
he
wishes
him
no
ill
will
“i
don’t
have
one
thing
against
him
in
any
way
in
the
world”
owen
said
“i
hope
he
has
a
good
life”
today
