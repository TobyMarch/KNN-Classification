there
are
hardly
any
active
rappers/producers
who've
been
successful
in
different
eras
but
seattle's
ishmael
butler
is
one
of
them
his
old
trio
digable
planets
won
a
grammy
back
in
1994
for
their
jazzy
song
rebirth
of
slick
(cool
like
dat)
back
when
butler
was
called
butterfly
joined
by
rappers
doodlebug
and
ladybug
mecca
now
he's
palaceer
lazaro
or
just
ish
in
his
current
duo
shabazz
palaces
which
stands
on
the
artistic
cuttingedge
with
a
scifi/african
style
seattle
almost
got
backtoback
concerts
from
both
acts
at
the
neptune
theatre
dec
28
and
29
—
which
would
have
been
rare
and
very
cool
but
at
the
last
minute
digable
planets
canceled
butler
called
me
to
explain
why
(see
partial
edited
transcript
below)
he
said
it
was
ladybug
mecca's
fault
for
being
difficult
to
work
with
and
he
does
not
see
a
future
for
digable
planets
calling
the
situation
a
heartbreaker
digable
planets
has
been
through
this
before
they
toured
with
a
mecca
standin
for
a
while
lady
madarocka
but
butler
didn't
want
to
do
that
again
i
didn't
want
to
compromise
the
integrity
of
the
originality
of
the
group
truth
be
told
mecca
did
not
respond
to
my
email
asking
for
her
side
of
the
story
as
it
stands
the
neptune
hosts
shabazz
palaces
with
theesatisfaction
dec
28
(look
out
for
my
concert
preview
soon)
the
following
night
digable
planets
has
been
replaced
with
hardcore
detroit
rapper
danny
brown
previously
bought
tickets
will
be
honored
at
the
brown
show
or
refunded
at
point
of
purchase
digable
fans
do
have
one
thing
to
look
forward
to
in
2013
though
one
of
their
albums
will
be
rereleased
with
new
liner
notes
ok
so
what
happened
with
the
digable
show?
mecca
in
all
her
royal
inglory
canceled
the
show
last
week
first
when
i
got
back
from
[shabazz
palaces'
fall
tour]
in
europe
i
called
her
like
yo
what
day
you
coming
out
here
so
we
can
rehearse?
and
she
was
like
i
can
only
come
out
on
a
friday
and
the
show's
on
saturday
she
said
she
had
a
prior
obligation
i'm
like
aight
if
that's
what
it
is
then
i'll
rehearse
everybody
and
when
you
get
here
you
can
just
fall
in
line
it'll
all
be
gravy
she
said
aight
the
next
day
i
called
her
and
she
didn't
call
me
back
so
then
i
emailed
her
and
was
like
what's
going
on?
she
was
like
how
much
is
the
promoter
giving
me?
'me'
like
that
and
i'm
like
you?
the
promoter's
paying
us
as
a
group
do
you
need
an
individual
contract?
she
never
hit
me
back
so
then
i
hit
her
like
what's
going
on?
i
need
to
know
what's
happening
so
i
can
take
care
of
you
whatever
so
then
she
calls
and
says
i
need
to
see
a
contract
so
i'm
like
cool
whatever
—
it's
the
neptune
[booked
by
seattle
theatre
group's
wellknown
talent
buyer]
adam
zacks
everything's
good!
i
didn't
know
what
she
was
worried
about
so
i
tracked
everything
down
sent
her
[a
copy
of]
the
contract
two
days
later
she
hits
me
back
and
says
nobody
signed
the
contract
is
this
thing
for
real?
i'm
like
mec
what
are
you
talking
about?
check
the
website
check
ticket
sales
check
anything
just
check
my
resume
of
course
it's
real
so
we
tracked
adam
down
again
this
is
all
going
through
[our
booking
agent]
so
we
get
[zacks]
to
sign
it
he
sends
it
to
her
she
emails
me
back
because
she
won't
answer
the
phone
and
says
hey
i
need
to
get
$5000
personally
my
definitive
rate
is
$5000
the
email
said
am
i
being
punked?
this
is
the
most
unprofessional
deal
i've
ever
been
a
part
of
my
definitive
rate
is
$5000
for
myself
not
including
expenses
and
travel
i
can't
do
this
you
wasted
everybody's
time
that's
what
the
email
said
and
then
she
wouldn't
pick
up
the
phone
or
answer
texts
so
i
don't
know
what
the
deal
is
maybe
she's
scared
or
doesn't
want
to
come
i
don't
know
what
she's
doing
for
entertainment
but
$5000
a
night
is
unheard
of
unless
you're
on
the
upper
levels
of
performing
and
calling
those
guys
unprofessionalit's
all
just
weird
but
one
time
[in
the
past]
we
had
a
25city
tour
set
up
which
she
set
up
—
made
us
quit
one
booking
agent
and
go
through
someone
that
she
wanted
to
go
with
—
and
the
day
before
the
tour
she
quit
the
tour
that
was
our
last
experience
with
her
so
this
time
was
kind
of
a
roll
of
the
dice
but
we
love
this
[music]
and
wanted
to
do
it
so
that's
what
happened
and
i
just
wanted
to
let
cats
know
that
knowledge
[aka
cee
knowledge/doodlebug]
and
i
more
than
making
money
we
just
feel
honored
and
crazysurprised
and
appreciative
that
fans
want
to
see
us
at
all
no
amount
of
money
or
small
amount
of
money
—
which
the
money
wasn't
small
at
all
trust
me
—
would
keep
us
from
performing
for
people
who
wanted
to
pay
to
see
us
perform
to
do
[what
mecca
did]
is
totally
disrespectful
and
a
lack
of
appreciation
for
the
fans
that
make
us
have
the
ability
to
do
the
things
we're
doing
now
in
the
present
so
i'm
sorry
for
that
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
tried
to
do
something
and
got
some
people
excited
to
come
see
the
show
and
wasn't
able
to
pull
it
off
but
i
tried
and
so
did
doodlebug
and
it's
really
through
no
fault
of
our
own
and
you
know
me
i
don't
even
like
talking
about
inside
stuff
but
this
was
a
different
situation
because
mecca
for
whatever
reason
ruined
it
and
tried
to
make
it
seem
like
the
deal
was
unprofessional
and
the
money
wasn't
right
but
i
know
that
the
deal
wasn't
unprofessional
and
i
also
know
that
the
money
was
really
good
it's
a
heartbreaker
sounds
like
she
was
making
those
stipulations
so
that
the
situation
could
be
impossible
i
can't
speculate
but
let
me
ask
you
this
let's
say
your
definitive
rate
was
$5000
wouldn't
that
be
the
first
thing
that
came
out
of
your
mouth?
why
you
asking
people
to
jump
through
all
these
hoops
and
at
the
end
of
all
the
hoops
then
you
pull
everything
with
the
price
bit?
so
would
you
say
digable's
status
is
indefinite
or
broken
up?
i
just
can't
see
it
i
think
it's
the
end
