buffalo
springfield
was
an
americancanadian

young
stephen
stills
and
richie
furay

the
first

american
bands

neil
young
and
stephen
stills
first
crossed
paths
in
1965
at
the
fourth
dimension
in
thunder
bay
ontario
young
was
there
with
the
squires
a
winnipeg
group
he
had
been
leading
since
february
1963
and
stills
was
on
tour
with
the
company
a
spin
off
from
the
au
go
go
singers
although
the
two
did
not
see
each
other
again
for
almost
a
year
the
encounter
left
both
with
a
strong
desire
to
work
together
when
the
company
broke
up
at
the
end
of
that
tour
stills
moved
to
the
west
coast
where
he
worked
as
a
studio
musician
and
auditioned
unsuccessfully
for
among
other
things
the
monkees[2]
he
had
been
in
a
band
called
buffalo
fish
with
fellow
greenwich
village
transplant
peter
tork
who
encouraged
him
to
audition
told
by
record
producer
barry
friedman
that
there
would
be
work
available
if
he
could
assemble
a
band
stills
invited
fellow
au
go
go
singers
alumnus
richie
furay
and
former
squires
bass
player
ken
koblun
to
come
join
him
in
california
both
agreed
although
koblun
chose
to
leave
before
very
long
and
joined
the
group
3's
a
crowd
in
early
1966
in
toronto
young
met
bruce
palmer
a
canadian
who
was
playing
bass
for
a
group
called
the
mynah
birds
in
need
of
a
lead
guitarist
palmer
invited
young
to
join
the
group
and
young
accepted
the
mynah
birds
were
set
to
record
an
album
for
motown
records
when
their
singer
ricky
james
matthews
(later
known
as
rick
james)
was
tracked
down
and
arrested
by
the
us
navy
for
being
awol
with
their
record
deal
canceled
young
and
palmer
decided
to
head
for
los
angeles
where
they
hoped
to
encounter
stills
roughly
a
week
later
discouraged
at
having
been
unable
to
locate
stills
and
ready
to
depart
for
san
francisco
they
were
stuck
in
traffic
on
sunset
boulevard
in
los
angeles
when
stills
furay
and
friedman
sitting
in
their
white
van
recognized
young's
black
1953
pontiac
hearse
which
happened
to
be
passing
by
in
the
opposite
direction
after
an
illegal
uturn
by
furay
some
shouting
handwaving
and
much
excitement
the
four
musicians
realized
that
they
were
united
in
their
determination
to
put
together
a
band
drummer
dewey
martin
who
had
played
with
garage
rock
group
the
standells
and
country
artists
such
as
patsy
cline
and
the
dillards
was
added
to
the
roster
less
than
a
week
later
after
contacting
the
group
at
the
suggestion
of
the
byrds'
manager
jim
dickson
taking
their
name
from
the
side
of
a
steamroller
made
by
the
buffalospringfield
roller
company
that
had
been
parked
on
the
street
outside
friedman's
house
(where
stills
and
furay
were
staying)
the
new
group
debuted
on
april
11
1966
at
the
troubadour
in
hollywood
a
few
days
later
they
began
a
short
tour
of
california
as
the
opening
act
on
a
bill
featuring
the
dillards
and
the
byrds
management
and
first
recordings
[edit]
no
sooner
had
the
byrds'
tour
ended
than
chris
hillman
persuaded
the
owners
of
the
whisky
a
go
go
to
give
the
band
an
audition
buffalo
springfield
essentially
became
the
house
band
at
the
whisky
for
seven
weeks
from
may
2
to
june
18
1966
this
series
of
concerts
solidified
the
band's
reputation
for
exhilarating
live
performances
and
attracted
interest
from
a
number
of
record
labels
it
also
brought
an
invitation
from
friedman
to
dickie
davis
who
had
been
lighting
manager
for
the
byrds
to
become
involved
in
the
group's
management
in
turn
davis
sought
advice
from
sonny

cher's
management
team
charlie
greene
and
brian
stone
they
eventually
struck
a
deal
with
ahmet
erteg&uumln
of
atlantic
records
and
arranged
for
the
band
to
start
recording
at
gold
star
studios
in
hollywood
young
stills
and
furay
all
recorded
demos
for
the
album
but
greene
and
stone
who
had
installed
themselves
as
the
album's
producers
deemed
young's
voice
too
weird
and
assigned
lead
vocals
on
the
majority
of
young's
songs
to
furay
the
first
buffalo
springfield
single
“nowadays
clancy
can’t
even
sing”
was
released
in
august
but
made
little
impact
outside
of
los
angeles
where
it
reached
the
top
25
the
group
was
dissatisfied
with
and
reworked
some
of
their
early
recording
efforts
for
the
rest
of
the
album
in
fact
young
and
stills
have
long
maintained
that
their
own
mono
mix
was
superior
to
the
stereo
mix
engineered
by
greene
and
stone
the
album
eponymously
titled
buffalo
springfield
was
originally
released
by
atlantic's
subsidiary
atco
in
mono
and
in
stereo
in
december
1966
a
revamped
version
(see
below)
issued
both
in
mono
and
stereo
with
a
different
track
order
came
in
march
1967
in
november
1966
stills
composed
his
landmark
song
for
what
it's
worth
after
witnessing
police
actions
against
the
crowds
of
young
people
who
had
gathered
on
the
sunset
strip
to
protest
the
closing
of
a
nightclub
called
pandora's
box
the
song
was
performed
on
thanksgiving
night
at
the
whisky
a
go
go
recorded
within
the
next
few
days
and
on
the
air
in
los
angeles
on
radio
station
khj
soon
afterward
by
march
1967
it
was
a
top
ten
hit
atco
took
advantage
of
this
momentum
by
replacing
the
song
baby
don't
scold
me
with
for
what
it's
worth
and
rereleasing
the
album
for
what
it's
worth
sold
over
one
million
copies
and
was
awarded
a
gold

[edit]
in
january
1967
the
group
took
an
advance
from
the
record
company
and
flew
to
new
york
to
perform
at
ondine's
a
club
where
the
doors
would
also
play
it
was
at
this
time
that
palmer
was
first
arrested
for
possession
of
marijuana
and
summarily
deported
back
to
canada
the
band
moved
back
and
forth
between
recording
sessions
and
live
appearances
on
both
coasts
a
number
of
different
bassists
were
used
such
as

appearance
on
the
the
smothers

was
taped
on

17
1967
airing
on
february
26[4]
under
these
conditions
work
on
the
new
album
tentatively
titled
stampede
was
markedly
tense
ever
distrustful
of
greene
and
stone
young
and
stills
also
bickered
between
themselves
and
each
insisted
on
producing
the
recording
sessions
for
his
own
compositions
furay
who
had
sung
and
played
guitar
on
the
first
album
but
had
not
contributed
any
songs
also
stepped
forward
and
equaled
young's
number
for
the
group's
second
album
although
palmer
returned
to
the
group
at
the
beginning
of
june
young
had
already
left
and
as
a
result
missed
the
celebrated
monterey
pop
festival
at
which
the
band
performed
with
former
daily
flash
and
future
rhinoceros
member
doug
hastings
on
guitar
and
guest
david
crosby
young
eventually
returned
on
october
7
or
8th
at
the
third
eye
in
redondo
beach
california
and
after
bidding
adieu
to
greene
and
stone
(erteg&uumln
convinced
the
duo
to
release
the
band
from
production
and
management
agreements)
the
band
divided
its
time
between
playing
concert
gigs
and
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
its
second
album
ultimately
titled
buffalo
springfield
again
produced
by
erteg&uumln
himself
although
more
of
an
amalgam
of
individual
work
than
an
integrated
group
effort
buffalo
springfield
again
is
considered
by
many
critics
and
fans
to
be
the
group's
finest
record
released
in
november
1967
it
includes
mr
soul
(the
version
of
which
that
appears
as
the
b
side
of
the
edited
bluebird
has
a
completely
different
guitar
lead
than
the
stereo
lp
version
and
has
yet
to
be
issued
on
cd)
rock

woman
bluebird
sad
memory

the
group
was
featured
playing
bluebird
in
an
episode
of
the
television
series
mannix
called
warning
live
blueberries
which
aired
on
october
28
1967
for
many
buffalo
springfield
fans
it
is
bluebird
a
stephen
stills
composition
that
was
then
and
remains
the
band's
peak
unlike
the
studio
version
–
which
winds
down
after
the
instrumental
break
with
a
plaintive
rendition
of
the
third
verse
accompanied
by
a
banjo
–
in
live
performances
the
opening
verses
of
bluebird
served
as
a
springboard
for
an
extended
jam
session
during
which
stills
young
and
furay
intertwined
guitars
for
minutes
on
end
one
such
live
jam
version
which
was
officially
released
on
the
1973
compilation
buffalo
springfield
had
become
a
staple
of
fm
radio
in
the
late
'60s
and
early
'70s
last
time
around
[edit]
with
strong
reviews
appearing
all
over
the
country
not
only
of
buffalo
springfield
again
but
of
the
band's
performance
as
part
of
the
beach
boys
fifth
annual
thanksgiving
tour
things
were
looking
up
however
in
january
1968
palmer's
second
deportation
for
drug
possession
once
again
threw
a
wrench
into
the
works
this
time
guitarist
and
studio
engineer
jim
messina
was
hired
as
a
permanent
replacement
on
bass
with
palmer
gone
for
good
young
also
began
to
appear
less
and
less
frequently
often
leaving
stills
to
handle
all
the
lead
guitar
parts
at
concerts
recording
sessions
were
booked
and
all
the
songs
that
appeared
on
their
final
album
were
recorded
by
the
end
of
march
usually
with
messina
producing
but
the
group
was
clearly
on
the
verge
of
disbanding
in
april
1968
after
yet
another
drug
bust
involving
young
furay
messina
and
eric
clapton
the
group
decided
to
break
up
the
final
20th
century
concert
appearance
was
at
the
long
beach
arena
on
may
5
1968
after
the
band
played
many
of
its
bestknown
tunes
an
extended
20plusminute
version
of
“bluebird”
became
the
group's
swan
song
buffalo
springfield
disbanded
a
little
more
than
two
years
after
it
had
begun
after
the
group's
breakup
furay
and
messina
compiled
various
tracks
recorded
between
mid1967
and
early
1968
into
a
third
and
final
studio
album
titled
last
time
around
although
it
featured
furay's
touching
ballad
kind
woman
young's
classic
i
am
a
child
and
stills'
subtle
political
four
days
gone
only
a
few
of
the
songs
included
more
than
two
or
three
members
of
the
group
at
a
time
even
the
cover
photo
was
a
montage
with
young's
image
added
to
a

profile
of
the
other
four
members
stills
and
furay
appeared
on
more
tracks
than
any
of
the
others
essentially
dominating
the
album
but
it
did
not
light
up
the
charts
legacy
[edit]
despite
their
popularity
buffalo
springfield
was
never
a
major
commercial
success
for
what
it’s
worth

a
significant
hit
and
the
group's
legend
grew
stronger
after

the
later
successes
of
its
members
the
longevity
