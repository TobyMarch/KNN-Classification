critically
and
commercially
successful
jane's
addiction
frontman
perry
farrell
and
drummer
stephen
perkins
formed
porno
for
pyros
after
acquiring
guitarist
peter
distefano
and
bass
player
martyn
lenoble
farrell
named
the
band
after
viewing
an
ad
for
fireworks
in
a
pornographic
magazine[2]
the
name
has
also
been
connected
through
song
lyrics
to
the
la
riots
which
occurred
in
the
band's
hometown
around
the
time
of
porno
for
pyros
inception[3]
prior
to
releasing
their
eponymous
first
album
porno
for
pyros
embarked
on
a
nationwide
tour
to
support
the
new
band
by
the
time
the
band's
debut
album
was
released
in
1993
anticipation
surrounding
the
project
was
enough
to
briefly
drive
the
album
to
the
no&nbsp3
position
on
the
billboard
top
200
list
reaction
to
the
album
was
mixed
with
some
fans
ecstatic
and
others
disappointed[citation
needed]
the
video
for
the
album's
first
single
pets
received
heavy
airplay
on
mtv
following
the
album's
release
porno

pyros
continued
a
heavy
touring
schedule
including
an
appearance
at
woodstock
94
along
with
a
cameo
on
hbo's
the
larry
sanders
show
unlike
the
relatively
straightahead
rock
shows
that
were
the
hallmark
of
live
jane's
addiction
porno
for
pyros
live
shows
relied
heavily
on
props
extras[4]
and
special
effects
(including
but
not
limited
to
pyrotechnics)
for
the
band's
followup
album
good
god's
urge
bass
player
lenoble
quit
after
completing
the
majority
of
the
bass
tracks
exminutemen
bassist
mike
watt
was
brought
in
to
finish
up
the
album
tracks[5]
and
join
the
band
on
tour[6]
the
album
also
featured
the
postjane's
reunion
of
farrell
with
guitarist
dave
navarro
who
made
a
guest
appearance
on
freeway
along
with
red
hot
chili
peppers'
bass
player
flea[7]
the
band
again
set
forth
on
a
heavy
touring
schedule
on
several
tour
stops
porno
for
pyros
played
mountain
song
a
popular
jane's
addiction
tune
and
was
a
foreshadowing
of
the
later
jane's
addiction
reunion
efforts
further
touring
by
the
band
was
scuttled
when
distefano
was
diagnosed
with
cancer[8]
perkins
and
watt
subsequently
formed
the
jazzpunk
improvisation
group
banyan[9]
and
along
with
distefano
occasionally
perform
sets
of
stooges
cover
versions
in
the
los

area
under
the
band
name
hellride[10]
