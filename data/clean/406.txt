signed
a
record
deal
with

a
minor
sensation
with
debut
single
i
wanna
be
with
you
tonight
grt
soon
went
bankrupt
and
due
to
a
hidden
clause
in
their
contract
the
band
was
prohibited
from
recording
and
releasing
new
music
they
secured
a
loan
to
buy
themselves
out
of
the
contract
as
the
decade
closed
alabama's
biggest
success
came
in
the
1980s
where
the
band
had
over
27
number
one
hits
seven
multiplatinum
albums
and
received
numerous
awards
alabama's
first

continued
to
receive
hit
singles
and
multiplatinum
record
sales
the
group
disbanded
in
2006

farewell
tour
and
two
albums
of
inspirational
music
but
reunited
in

and
have
continued
to
record
and
tour
worldwide
the
band's
blend
of
traditional
country
music
and
southern
rock
combined
with
elements
of
gospel
music
and
pop
music
gave
it
a
crossover
appeal
that
helped
lead
to
their
unprecedented
success
they
also
toured
extensively
and
incorporated
production
elements
such
as
lighting
and
sets
inspired
by
rock
concerts
into
their
shows
the
band
has
over
30
number
one
country
records
on
the
billboard
charts
to
their
credit
and
have
sold
over
75
million
albums
making
them
one
of
the
world's
bestselling
bands
of
all
time[2]
allmusic
credited
the
band
with
popularizing
the
idea
of
a
country
band
and
wrote
that
it's
unlikely
that
any
other
country
group
will
be
able
to
surpass
the
success
of
alabama[3]

day
jobs
and
moved
to
myrtle
beach
south
carolina
where
they
had
a
job
playing
at
the
bowery
the
band
was
asked
to
play
the
entire
summer
as
the
house
band
requiring
them
to
move
to
myrtle
beach
when
they
got
to
the
bar
the
bowery
had
already
hired
a
singer
making
wildcountry
the
backup
band
each
member
of
wildcountry
eventually
had
a
chance
to
sing
due
to
the
fact
that
they
would
play
for
hours
on
end
playing
for
free
taking
home
only
what
they
earned
in
tips
the
group
had
a
hard
time
keeping
a
drummer
but
found
mark
herndon
at
a
club
in
florence
south
carolina
in
1978
mark's
mother
had
been
working
at
the
club
and
heard
the
group
needed
a
drummer
mark
joined
in
1979
the
band
was
able
to
play
their
own
material
and
test
it
in
front
of
the
crowds
they'd
return
to
the
bowery
every
easter
weekend
and
play
through
labor
day
weekend
the
band
later
opened
for
the
doobie
brothers
and
started
to
focus
more
on
recording
an
album
and
getting
a
single
out
when
randy
turned
twenty
three
he
met
his
soon
to
be
wife
kelly
who
was
fifteen
at
the
time
kelly
had
been
to
the
bowery
and
the
two
met
and
quickly
fell
in
love
randy
wanted
to
marry
her
but
her
mother
objected
due
to
her
daughter's
age
kelly
eventually
went
to
germany
for
two
years
before
returning
to
the
states
kelly's
friends
had
staged
a
car
wash
to
raise
money
to
buy
kelly
a
ticket
home
the
two
were
married
soon
after
the
alabama
band
[edit]
in
1977
they
signed
a
contract
to
record
a
one
shot
record
with
grt
(general
recorded
tape
inc)
and
changed
their
name
from
wildcountry
to
the
alabama
band
at
grt's
request
the
bowery
had
small
signs
that
wrapped
around
the
stage
with
the
names
of
the
fifty
states
on
them
the
band
grabbed
the
alabama
sign
and
put
it
on
the
wall
behind
them
because
that
was
where
they
were
from
wildcountry
didn't
have
any
signs
or
banners
just
the
sign
that
said
alabama
hanging
on
the
wall
behind
them
when
it
came
time
to
rename
the
band
randy
looked
no
further
than
the
sign
on
the
wall
the
alabama
band
recorded
i
want
to
be
with
you
tonight
which
broke
the
top

bought
out
their

in
a
beat
up
van
they
called
the
blue
goose
working
for
more
than
a
year
to
raise
the
funds
to
buy
out
their
contract
due
to
all
of
the
financial
woes
the
band
had
faced
randy
decided
that
teddy
jeff
and
he
should
be
equal
partners
in
the
band
although
future
hired
members
would
be
entitled
to
royalties
if
their
work
and
image
were
portrayed
as
a
contributing

eventually
recorded
my

and
attempted
to

the
other
members
of

group
sued
drummer
mark
herndon
for
$202670
in
money
allegedly
overpaid
to
him
three
years
earlier
after
the
band's
farewell
tour
concluded
this
money
was
allegedly
factored
into
the
net
profit
and
given
to
herndon
before
accounting
was
completed
an
allegation
herndon
has
denied
the
band
did
not
sue
herndon
until
he
requested
money
from
the
multiple
live
albums
and
songs
that
the
band
had
released
but
never
paid
herndon
for
playing
on
by
filing
the
lawsuit
alabama
band
attorneys
mistakenly
included
copies
of
band
contracts
as
exhibits
along
with
their
lawsuit
papers
thus
allowing
fans
a
chance
to
look
at
the
inner
workings
of
the
band
and
revealing
that
herndon
actually
had
a
contractual
full
band
share
of
the
farewell
tour[10]
since
1982
herndon
has
been
a
paid
employee
of

inc
as
the
drummer
for
alabama
according
to
the
court
papers
in
december
2002
a
new
contract
was
signed
which
provided
that
herndon
would
be
paid
an
annual
salary
of
$100000
and
receive
a
22725
percent
share
of
“net

performance
revenue
actually
received
by
the
group
'alabama'
the
suit
which
names
the
group
alabama
inc
as
the
plaintiff
also
states
that
herndon
demanded
a
payment
of
$6504701
which
represents
his
share
of
an
advance
against
anticipated
sales
of
the
the
last
stand
cd
which
was
recorded
live
during
the
farewell
tour
and
was
sold
by
cracker

the
contract
also
states
that
mr
herndon
is
entitled
to
receive
the
same
percentage
of
net
revenues
from
new
recordings
on
which
he
played
herndon
played
