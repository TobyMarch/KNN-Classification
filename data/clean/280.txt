era
of
popmetal
with

1986
blockbuster
slippery

and
its
hit
singles
you
give

a
bad

wanted
dead

and
living

bon
jovi
wound
up
transcending
the
bighaired
80s
withstanding
changes
in
style
and
sound
to
become
one
of
the
biggest
american
rock
bands
of
their
time
selling
over
120
million
albums
worldwide
and
sustaining
their
popularity
well
into
the
new
millennium
as
the
times
changed
so
did
the
bands
sound
they
slowly
peeled
away
the
arena
rock
guitars
of
the
80s
occasionally
scoring
on
the
adult
contemporary
charts
and
sometimes
singing
country
music
without
ever
rejecting
hard
rock
a
move
that
illustrated
how
they
never
abandoned
their
roots
and
became
second
only
to
bruce
springsteen
in
defining
the
sound
and
spirit
of
new
jersey
rock

roll
bon
jovi
took
their
name
from
lead
singer
jon
bon
jovi
(born
jon
bongiovi)
who
spent
his
adolescence
playing
in
local
jersey
bands
with
david
bryan
(born
david
rashbaum)
jons
cousin
tony
bongiovi
owned
the
celebrated
new
york
recording
studio
the
power
station
and
jon
spent
many
hours
there
working
as
a
janitor
and
recording
demos
after
hours
sometimes
supported
by
members
of
the
e
street
band
or
aldo
nova
one
of
those
demos
runaway
became
a
hit
on
local
new
jersey
radio
and
lead
to
the
formation
of
bon
jovi
the
band
as
jon
and
bryan
were
supported
by
guitarist
dave
sabo
bassist
alec
john
such
and
drummer
tico
torres
runaway
spurred
a
majorlabel
bidding
war
leading
to
a
contract
with
polygram/mercury
in
1983
before
the
group
entered
the
studio
though
bon
jovi
replaced
sabo
with
richie
sambora
a
working
guitarist
with
a
long
r&eacutesum&eacute
including
a
stint
as
a
member
of
message
bon
jovi
released
their
eponymous
debut
album
in
1984
generating
a
top
40
hit
with
the
original
version
of
runaway
the
following
year
7800&deg
fahrenheit
was
released
and
went
gold
all
serving
as
a
prelude
to
the
band's
1986
breakthrough
slippery
when
wet
paul
stanley
had
given
jon
and
richie
the
phone
number
of
professional
songwriter
desmond
child
and
together
they
wrote
two
of
the
album's
biggest
hits
in
richie's
parents'
basement
the
trio
composed
30
songs
in
total
and
auditioned
them
for
local
new
jersey
and
new
york
teenagers
basing
the
album's
running
order
on
their
opinions
supported
by
several
appealing
straightforward
videos
that
received
heavy
rotation
on
mtv
the
record
took
off
on
the
strength
of
you
give
love
a
bad
name
followed
quickly
by
livin
on
a
prayer
and
wanted
dead
or
alive
those
three
top
ten
hits
helped
propel
slippery
when
wet
to
sales
of
nine
million
in
the
us
alone
establishing
bon
jovi
as
superstars
in
their
home
country
their
fame
was
not
limited
to
the
us
though
as
the
album
also
turned
into
a
significant
hit
in
europe
canada
japan
and
australia
bon
jovi
built
upon
slippery
when
wet's
formula
with
1988's
new
jersey
which
shot
to
number
one
upon
its
release

was
only
slightly
less
successful
than

reunited

record
their
fifth
album

which
was
released
in
the
fall
of
1992
while
the
album
didn't
match
the
blockbuster
status
of
its
predecessors
it
did
produce
a
hit
with
bed
of
roses
an
adult
contemporarystyled
ballad
that
helped
sustain
the
bands
popularity
a
greatesthits
album
called
cross
road
appeared
in
1994
and
yielded
another
top
ten
ballad
always
around
the
same
time
bassist
alec
john
such
left
the
band
hugh
mcdonald
who
appeared
on
bon
jovi
recordings
stretching
back
as
far
as
runaway
became
his
unofficial
replacement
and
featured
prominently
on
the
bands
next
album
released
in
the
fall
of
1995
these
days
turned
into
another
us
top
ten
as
well
as
a
popular
european
hit
after
appearing
in
the
1996
film
moonlight
and
valentino
jon
bon
jovi
released
his
first
official
solo
album
destination
anywhere
in
the
summer
of
1997
during
the
tailend
of
the
'90s
the
members
of
bon
jovi
engaged
in
different
projects

sambora
released
a
sophomore
solo
set
called
undiscovered
soul
in
1998

before
easing
back
into
work
in
1999
via
a
song
for
edtv
then
beginning
work
on
a
fulllength
record
the
resulting
album
crush
appeared
in
2000
and
constituted
something
of
a
comeback
in
america
thanks
to
the
smash
single
its
my
life
a
crossplatform
hit
single
with
long
legs
thank
you
for
loving
me
also
turned
into
a
hit
helping
crush
go
double
platinum
in
the
us
and
selling
eight
million
copies
worldwide
bon
jovi
quickly
followed
crush
with
their
eighth
studio
effort
bounce
which
appeared
in
fall
2002
and
supported
the
record
with
another
international
tour
in
2003
the
band
rerecorded
many
of
its
most
wellknown
songs
for
the

allnew
have
a
nice
day

the
first
of
several
albums
produced
by
john
shanks
that
album's
success
was
aided
in
part
by
the
single
who
says
you
cant
go
home
featuring
guest
vocals
from
sugarland's
jennifer
nettles
which
eventually
won
the
grammy
award
for
best
country
collaboration
with
vocals

as
well
as
topping
the
charts
in
japan
australia
europe
and
canada
the
band
spent
the
following
year
in
the
studio
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
a
collection
of
popinfused
heartland
country
anthems
the
resulting
lost

which
featured
duets
with
leann
rimes
and
big

rich
arrived
in
the
summer
of
2007
and
grabbed
the
band
a
healthy
new
country
music
fan
base
in
the
process
lost
highway's
crossgenre
formula
proved
to
be
quite
potent
securing
the
band
its
third
number
one
album
in
the
us
bon
jovi
returned
to
rock
shortly
thereafter
though
with
the
release
of
the

in

offered
plenty
of
hits
along
with
two
new
tracks
no

and
what

in
the
first
years
of
the

pursued
solo
projects
the
most
notable
being
