after
garth
brooks
alan
jackson
was
the
most
popular
male
country
singer
of
the
'90s
an
heir
to
the
new
traditionalist
movement
of
the
'80s
jackson's
approach
was
rooted
in
classic
honky
tonk
yet
remained
comfortably
within
the
contemporary
mainstream
jackson's
hallmark
was
consistency

he
wrote
many
of
his
own
hits
and
his
way
with
a
hook
was
part
of
the
reason
he
never
really
hit
a
commercial
dry
spell
even
into
the
new
millennium
he
also
projected
a
modest
wholesome
downtoearth
image
that
made
him
one
of
the
bestliked
stars
of
his
era
even
apart
from
his
music
the
total
package
resulted
in
an
astounding
20
number
one
singles
and
20
more
top
ten
hits
all
in
the
first
12
years
of
his
career
jackson
was
born
in
the
small
town
of
newnan
georgia
on
october
17
1958
he
grew
up
singing
gospel
music
both
in
church
and
at
home
with
his
family
and
as
a
teenager
he
performed
locally
as
part
of
a
country
duo
he
left
school
to
work
and
married
his
high
school
sweetheart
denise
who
worked
as
an
airline
stewardess
during
the
early
'80s
jackson
held
down
a
series
of
odd
jobs

car
salesman
construction
worker
forklift
operator
at
kmart

while
playing
the
local
club
circuit
with
his
band
dixie
steel
and
working
on
his
songwriting
he
caught
his
big
break
when
denise
found
countrypop
star
glen
campbell
waiting
for
a
flight
and
gave
him
a
copy
of
her
husband's
demo
tape
campbell
in
turn
gave
her
contact
information
for
his
music
publishing
company
and
the
jacksons
picked
up
and
moved
to
nashville
shortly
thereafter
campbell's
company
suggested
that
alan
take
a
year
and
hone
his
songwriting
even
further
and
so
he
worked
more
odd
jobs

including
in
the
mail
room
at
the
nashville
network
plus
some
session
singing

before
finally
signing
on
as
a
staff
writer
by
night
he
performed
in
nashville
clubs
and
recorded
an
updated
demo
with
songwriter/producer
keith
stegall
in
1989
jackson
became
the
first
artist
signed
to
arista's
new
country
division
jackson's
debut
album
here
in
the
real
world
was
issued
in
1990
and
became
a
platinumselling
hit
on
the
strength
of
four
top
five
hits
the
title
cut
chasin'
that
neon
rainbow
wanted
and
the
first
of
many
charttoppers
i'd
love
you
all
over
again
he
shot
to
fullfledged
superstardom
with
the
followup
1991's
don't
rock
the
jukebox
whose
title
track
was
an
inescapable
number
one
smash
that
year
the
record
produced
three
more
number
ones
(someday
dallas
love's
got
a
hold
on
you)
and
also
contained
one
of
jackson's
signature
songs
the
top
five
midnight
in
montgomery
which
told
the
story
of
a
visit
to
hank
williams'
grave
also
in
1991
jackson
cowrote
several
songs
with
randy
travis
for
travis'
high
lonesome
album
with
1992's
a
lot
about
livin'
(and
a
little
'bout
love)
jackson
took
his
place
as
not
only
one
of
the
most
popular
stars
of
his
time
but
also
one
of
the
best
the
number
one
smash
chattahoochee
became
another
signature
tune
and
jackson
also
topped
the
charts
with
she's
got
the
rhythm
(and
i
got
the
blues)
while
scoring
three
more
top
five
hits
from
the
album

which
became
his
first
to
top
the
country
lp
charts
in
late
1993
jackson
released
the
stopgap
holiday
album
honky
tonk
christmas
which
actually
avoided
standards
in
favor
of
lesserknown
material
he
returned
in
1994
with
who
i
am
his
second
straight
number
one
country
album
which
gave
him
a
staggering
four
number
one
singles
a
cover
of
eddie
cochran's
summertime
blues
the
music
biz
satire
gone
country
(a
dig
at
executives
hopping
on
the
commercial
country
bandwagon)
livin'
on
love
and
i
don't
even
know
your
name
in
only
his
fifth
year
on
the
scene
jackson
was
able
to
issue
the
greatest
hits
collection
in
1995
and
scored
hits
with
three
newly
minted
songs
a
cover
of
george
jones'
tall
tall
trees
i'll
try
(both
number
ones)
and
home
it
took
the
greatest
hits
collection
only
a
year
to
sell
over
three
million
copies
and
of
course
jackson
was
far
from
done
1996's
everything
i
love
became
his
fourth
straight
release
to
top
the
country
album
charts
and
it
gave
him
five
top
ten
hits
including
the
number
ones

and
there
goes

an
enormous
