2008
career
beginning
and
formation
[edit]
nate
ruess's
band
the
format
split
in
february
2008
immediately
afterward
nate
ruess
asked
andrew
dost
and
jack
antonoff
to
join
his
new
project
dost
had
toured
with
the
format
and
provided
various
instrumentation
and
ruess
met
antonoff
after
the
format
toured
with
steel
train[4]
the
three
began
working
together
in
new
jersey
within
a
week
ruess
sang
melodies
while
the
other
two
provided
music
for
them[5]
the
first
demo
song
the
band
recorded
was
benson
hedges
which
was
made
available
free
in
spin's

fun
then
approached
steven
mcdonald
who
produced
the
format's
album
dog
problems
with
ruess
to
produce
their
debut
album
mcdonald
was
enthusiastic
about
the
project
and
stated
i
can’t
believe
what
we’re
working
on
here
this
crushes
anything
i’ve
ever
done[5]
2009–2010
aim
and
ignite
[edit]
recording
took
place
in
the
fall
of
2008
the
band's
first
single
at
least
i'm
not
as
sad
as
i
used
to
be
was
made
available
as
a
free
download
on
the
band's
myspace
page
on
april
6
2009[7]
aim
and
ignite
was
released
on
august
25
2009
and
received
positive
reviews
absolutepunknet's
drew
beringer
praised
the
album
stating
it
was
what
a
pop
album
'should'
sound
like
and
the
most
essential
pop
album
of
2009[8]
allmusic
called
the
album
progressive
but
in
the
best
possible
way
and
admired
ruess's
lyrics
for
investigating
the
larger
truths
of
lifewith
a
witty
approach
that
keeps
the
songs
bubbling
merrily
along
on
a
positive
note[9]
dave
de
sylvia
of
sputnikmusic
wrote
aim
and
ignite
isn’t
the
most
consistent
pop
album
around
but
he
ultimately
commended
the
album
as
a
superbly
mixed
and
arranged
album
made
by
musicians
who
clearly
understand
the
limits
and
potential
of
pop
music[10]
estella
hung
of
popmatters
was
less
impressed
with
the
album
she
praised
songs
be
calm
and
the
gambler
but
criticized
the
lyrics
and
production
of
the
album's
early
tracks
hung
concluded
that
while
aim
and
ignite
is
pretty
original
to
say
the
least
it
fails
to
live
up
to
the
format’s
last
outing[11]
popdose's
ken
shane
called
the
album
an
interesting
and
unusual
listen
shane
applauded
the
album's
songwriting
and
said
many
of
the
songs
are
really
good
but
he
objected
to
the
cute
production
desiring
to
hear
the
band
in
a
more
strippeddown
form
he
ended
his
review
with
i
have
a
similar
problem
with
dr
dog
a
band
that
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
number
of
people
i
think
much
of
their
recorded
work
is
too
fussed
over
but
when
i
saw
them
live
and
their
sound
was
more
stripped
down
out
of
necessity
emphasizing
their
powerful
songwriting
i
thought
they
were
wonderful
perhaps
the
same
fate
awaits
me
with
fun[12]
in
reviewing
the
album
the
washington
post
called
some
of
the
arrangements
theatrical
much
like
those
on
panic
at
the
disco's
2005
debut[13]
the
album
reached
number
26
