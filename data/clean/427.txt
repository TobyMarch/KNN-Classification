we
are
tonight
is
amazing!
what
i
love
the
most
about
billy
besides
his
sweet
voice
is
that
he
doesn't
change
the
essence
of
his
music
to
become
more
commercial
i
guess
this
might
be
bad
if
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
to
be
a
mainstream
artist
but
that's
why
i
rather
listen
to
his
songs
which
sounds
something
different
than
the
sound
of
other
artists
that
change
their
authenticity
to
have
a
chance
to
play
on
the
radio
more
often
doing
pretty
much
the
same
so
i
expect
that
billy
gets
the
success
he
deserves
with
this
new
album
but
without
losing
what
makes
him
different
from
other
country
singers
his
talented
voice
and
unique
music
