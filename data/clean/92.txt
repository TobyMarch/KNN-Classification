name
[edit]
the
archduke
franz
ferdinand
of
austria
inspired
the
band's
name
the
name
of
the
band
was
originally
inspired
by
a
racehorse
called
archduke
ferdinand[33]
after
seeing
the
horse
win
the
northumberland
plate
in
2001
the
band
began
to
discuss
archduke
franz
ferdinand
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
band
name
because
of
the
alliteration
of
the
name
and
the
implications
of
the
archduke's
death
(his
assassination
was
a
significant
factor
in
the
leadup
to
world
war
i)[34]
mainly
we
just
liked
the
way
it
sounded
says
bob
we
liked
the
alliteration
he
was
an
incredible
figure
as
well
continues
alex
his
life
or
at
least
the
ending
of
it
was
the
catalyst
for
the
complete
transformation
of
the
world
and
that
is
what
we
want
our
music
to
be
but
i
don't
want
to
overintellectualize
the
name
thing
basically
a
name
should
just
sound
good

like
music
paul
offered
i
like
the
idea
that
if
we
become
popular
maybe
the
words
franz
ferdinand
will
make
people
think
of
the
band
instead
of
the
historical
figure[8]
the
song
take
me
out
on
the
band's
first
album
was
the
second
single
to
be
released
by
the
band
the
single
release
of
take
me
out
came
with
the
bside
all
for
you
sophia
based
on
the
assassination
of
archduke
ferdinand
and
his
wife
whose
name
was
sophie
not
sophia
the
band
chose
the
name
sophia
rather
than
sophie
to
give
the
song
a
better
ring
the
song
mentions
the
assassin
gavrilo
princip
the
black
hand
the
location
of
the
apple
quay
and
urban
(franz
urban)
the
name
often
mistakenly
given
to
leopold
lojka
the
driver
of
the
car
in
addition
to
this
in
2004
the
band
played
a
number
of
secret
gigs
under
the
pseudonym
the
black
hands
alluding
to
the
secret
society
that
was
held
responsible
for
the
assassination
of
franz
ferdinand[35][36]

the
band
is
notable
for
its
use
of
russian
avantgarde
imagery
in
album
and
single
covers
designed
by
matthew
cooper
examples
include
you
could
have

which
references
a
1924
portrait
of
lilya
brik
by
alexander
rodchenko
take

this

whites
with
the
red
wedge
by
el
lissitzky
and
michael
with
single
art
based
on
a
proun
by
lissitzky
the
song
love
and
destroy
was
inspired
by
the
scene
of
disorder
made
by
margarita
a
character
of
michael
bulgakov's
the
master
and
margarita
in
the
apartment

also
in

the

dal&iacute
music
videos
[edit]
many
of
the
videos
to
promote
the
band's
singles
take
inspiration
from
russian
avantgarde
much
like
their
lp
and
cd
sleeves
the
avantgarde
music
video
for
take
me
out
directed
by
jonas
odell
was
inspired
by
dadaism
(especially
max
ernst's
une
semaine
de
bont&eacute)
busby
berkeley
choreographies
and
russian
constructivist
design[37]
alex
kapranos
explained
the
many
and
varied
influences
behind
the
1930sstyle
promo
for
second
single
take
me
out
it's
kind
of
two
dimensional
in
a
three
dimensional
style
if
that
makes
any
sense
it's
a
montage
of
images
ourselves
pictures
and
things
taken
from
other
places
and
put
together
in
a
strange
abstract
way
that's
what
gives
the
video
that
strange
jerky
style[37]
the
video
for
this
fire
is
similar
to
take
me
out
in
style
the
lyrics
of
do
you
want
to
make
reference
to
parties
at
the
trendy
glasgow
art
gallery
transmission
and
the
video
includes
a
variety
of
the
work
of
contemporary
artist
vanessa
