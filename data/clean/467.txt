classic
love
song
this
tune
mourns
a
oncesolid
relationship
that
has
turned
cold
and
distant
over
time
with
heartbreaking
lyrics
like
when
we
don't
talk
when
we
don't
touch
/
when
it
doesn't
feel
like
we're
even
in
love
/
it
matters
to
me

title
track
of

(2004)
&nbsp
&nbsp
cowritten
by
john
rich
specifically
for
the

native
the

boasts
that
a

don't
change
her
ways
just
'cause
everybody
knows
her

life
including
seeing
her
face
on
the
big
movie
screen
and
ridin'
[her]
kids
around
piggy
back
the
song
was
believable
enough
to
take
faith
back
to
no1
after
a
fiveyear
absence
from
the
chart's
top
spot
&nbsp

'like
we
never

(2004)
&nbsp
&nbsp

tragic

of
former
lovers
who
run
into
each
other
after
they
have
broken
up
features
faith's
husband
tim
mcgraw
on
additional
vocals
and
in
the
video
as
the
man
she
once
loved
singing
time

leaving
us
behind
/
another

'there
you'll
be'
from
'pearl
harbor'
soundtrack
(2001)
&nbsp
&nbsp
this
song
didn't
quite
make
it
into
the
top
10
on
the
country
charts
but
it
soared
to
the
top
of
the
adult
contemporary
charts
thanks
to
its
inclusion
in
the
soundtrack
for
the
2001
oscarwinning
film
'pearl
harbor'
faith's
rendition
of
this
diane
warrenpenned
hit
which
was
also
nominated
for
an
academy
award
for
best
original
song
helped
cement
her
position
as
a
musical
superstar
who
can
seamlessly
transcend
genres
&nbsp

'stronger'
from
'cry'
(2002)
&nbsp
&nbsp
it's
hard
to
find
a
song
in
faith's
catalog
that
showcases
her
incredible
vocal
range
better
than
this
album
cut
from
her
fifth
studio
cd
'cry'
just
watch
her
perform
'stronger'
live
and
you'll
see
that
her
producers
have
a
pretty
easy
job

no
protools
required
faith
grew
up
singing
gospel
in
church
and
certainly
carried
that
over
in
her
career
with
a
great
example
being
this
soulful
song
that
lifts
spirits
in
tough
times
&nbsp
4
'let
me
let
go'
from
'faith'
(1998)
&nbsp
&nbsp
this
grammynominated
hit
includes
guest
vocals
by
vince
gill
whose
rich
voice
blends
perfectly
with
faith's
to
pack
quite
the
emotional
punch
in
this
heartwrenching
ballad
begging
the
memory
of
a
lost
love
to
stop
lingering
in
her
mind
faith's
rendition
of
the
song
took
her
all
the
way
to
no
1
on
the
charts
and
scored
her
an
invitation
to
perform
at
the
2000
grammy
awards

'it's
your
love'
from
tim
mcgraw
'everywhere'
(1997)
&nbsp
&nbsp
we
stole
this
duet
from
faith's
husband
tim
who
included
it
on
his
multiplatinum
album
'everywhere'
the
accompanying
video
which
featured
faith
very
pregnant
with
their
first
daughter
gracie
was
one
of
the
public's
first
glimpses
into
one
of
country
music's
most
enduring
love
stories
with
lines
like
better
than
i
was
/
more
than
i
am
/
and
all
of
this
happened
by
taking
your
hand
this
is
still
a
wedding
song
staple
many
years
later
&nbsp
2
'breathe'
from
'breathe'
(1999)
&nbsp
&nbsp
if
ever
there
was
a
definitive
career
song
for
faith
hill
this
is
it
the
sensual
sexy
love
song's
popularity
increased
exponentially
when
the
video
of
the
song
which
featured
faith
writhing
on
a
bed
clad
only
in
a
sheet
hit
the
airwaves
reaching
no2
on
billboard's
hot
100
as
well
as
staying
on
top
of
the
country
charts
for
four
weeks
this
song
is
still
popular
on
adult
contemporary
radio
today

'this
kiss'
from
'faith'
(1998)
&nbsp
&nbsp
never
has
a
song
better
reflected
the
spinetingling
elation
felt
during
the
first
kiss
with
a
crush
this
song
gave
faith
solid
footing
in
the
pop
and
country
worlds
with
kissable
lines
like
it's
centrifugal
motion
/
it's
perpetual
bliss
/
it's
that
pivotal
moment

ethereal
video
for
the

featuring
her
jumping
on

nectarine
makes
this
our
alltime
favorite
faith
