at
the
time)
in
order
to

father
was
a

billy
reluctantly
began
piano
lessons
at
an
early
age
at
his
mother's
insistence
his
teachers
including
the
noted
american
pianist
morton
estrin[10]
and
musician
timothy
ford
he
was
bullied
because
of
his
interest
in
music
rather
than
sports[citation
needed]
as
a
teenager
joel
took
up
boxing
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
defend
himself[citation
needed]
he
boxed
successfully
on
the
amateur
golden
gloves
circuit
for
a
short
time

attendance[12]
at
the
end
of

senior
year
joel
did
not
have
enough
credits
to
graduate
rather
than
attend
summer
school
to
earn
his
diploma
joel
decided
to
begin
a
career
in
music
i
told
them
'to
hell
with
it
if
i'm
not
going
to
columbia
university
i'm
going
to
columbia
records
and
you
don't
need
a

diploma
over
there'[13]
joel
did
in

eventually
sign
with

career
[edit]
early
career
[edit]
after
seeing
the
beatles
on
the
ed
sullivan
show
joel
decided
to
pursue
a
career
in
music
in
an
interview
he
said
of
the
group's
impact
that
one
performance
changed
my
life

up
to
that
moment
i'd
never
considered
playing
rock
as
a
career
and
when
i
saw
four
guys
who
didn't
look
like
they'd
come
out
of
the
hollywood
star
mill
who
played
their
own
songs
and
instruments
and
especially
because
you
could
see
this
look
in
john
lennon's
face

and
he
looked
like
he
was
always
saying
'f
you!'

i
said
'i
know
these
guys
i
can
relate
to
these
guys
i
am
these
guys'
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
do

play
in
a
rock
band'[15]
joel
founded
the
echoes
a
group
that
specialized
in
british
invasion
covers
when
the
echoes
became
popular
in
new
york
joel
left
high
school
to
become
a
professional
musician[16]
the
echoes
began
recording
in
1965
billy
joel
was
originally
hired
by
snuff
garret
as
a
pianist
for
bobby
vee
however
he
was
fired
before
doing
any
records
or
shows
because
he
refused
to
wear
the
matching
jackets
the
band
was
to
wear
[citation

billy
joel
(then

in
1967
to
join
the

a
long

next
year
and
a
half
they
released
four
singles
and
two
albums
(the
hassles
and
hour
of
the
wolf)
all
were
commercial
failures
joel
and
drummer
jon
small
left
the
hassles
in
1969
to
form
the
duo
attila
releasing
an
eponymous
debut

was
a
technical
and
commercial
disappointment

mastered
the
album
incorrectly
distorting
joel's
vocals
joel
soon
grew
frustrated
with
ripp's
incompetence
and
with
the
onerous
terms
of
their

as
a
sarcastic

the
success
of
his
pianodriven
ballads
like
just
the
way
you
are
she's
always
a
woman
and
honesty
led
some
critics
to
label
joel
a
balladeer
and
soft
rocker
joel
thought
these
labels
were
unfair
and
insulting
and
with
glass
houses
he
tried
to
record
an
album
that
proved
that
he
could
rock
harder
than
his
critics
gave
him
credit
for
occasionally
imitating
and
referencing
the
style
of
new
wave
rock
music
that
was
starting
to
become
popular
at
the
time
on
the

cover
of
the

the
adage
that
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
shouldn't
throw
stones)
glass

spent
6
weeks
at

on
the
billboard

and
yielded
such
hits
as

the
album's
closing
song
through
the
long

(bside

the

to
many
of
his
earlier
compositions
the

(#23)
it
sold
over
3&nbspmillion
copies
though
not
as
successful
as
some
of
his
previous
albums
the
album
was
still
considered
a
success
by
joel[20]
the
next
wave
of
joel's
career
commenced
with
the
recording
of
the
nylon
curtain
with
the
nylon
curtain
joel
became
more
ambitious
with
his
songwriting
trying
his
hand
at
writing
topical
songs
like
allentown
and
goodnight
saigon
joel
has
stated
that
he
wanted
the
album
to
communicate
his
feelings
about
the
american
dream
and
how
changes
in
american
politics
during
the
reagan
years
meant
that
all
of
a
sudden
you
weren't
going
to
be
able
to
inherit
[the
kind
of
life]
your
old
man
had[29]
he
also
tried
to
be
more
ambitious
in
his
use
of
the
recording
studio
joel
said
that
he
wanted
to
create
a
sonic
masterpiece
on
the
nylon
curtain
so
he
spent
more
time
in
the
studio
crafting
the
sound
of
the
album
than
he
had
on
any
previous
album[29]
work
began
on
the
nylon
curtain
in
the
fall
of

temporary
delayed
when
he
was
involved
in
a
serious
motorcycle
accident
on

on
april

still
joel
quickly
recovered
from
his
injuries
and
the

only
ended
up
being

by
a
few

in
august
1987
the
entourage
was
filmed
for
television
and
video
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
trip
and
the
concerts
were
simulcast
on
radio
around
the
world
most
of
that
audience
took
a
long
while
to
warm
up
to
joel's
energetic
show
something
that
had
never
happened
in
other
countries
he
had
performed
in
according
to
joel
each
time
the
fans
were
hit
with
the
bright
lights
anybody
who
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
froze
in

people
who
were
overreacting
were
removed
by

it
was
during
this
concert
that
joel
enraged
by
the
bright
lights
flipped
his
piano
and
snapped
a
microphone

made
it
to

in
early
1990
the

was
also
notable
for
its
song

written
after
joel
met
a
clown
in
the
soviet
city
of
that
name
during
his
tour
in

wellknown
single
from
the

is
the
ballad
and
so
it
goes
(#37
in

the
song
was
originally
written
in
1983
around
the
time
joel
was
writing
songs
for
an
innocent
man
but
and
so
it
goes
did
not
fit
that
album's
retro
theme
so
it
was
held
back
until
storm
front
joel
said
in
a
1996
masterclass
session
in
pittsburgh
that
storm
front
was
a
turbulent
album
and
that
and
so
it
goes
as
the
last
song
on
the
album
portrayed
the
calm
and
tranquility
that
often
follows
a
violent
thunderstorm
in
the
summer
of
1992

“
my
parents
were
both
from
jewish
families
i
was
not
brought
up
jewish
in
any
religious
way
my
circumcision
was
as
jewish
as
they
got
i
used
to
go
to
roman
catholic
church
with
my
friends
and
when
i
was
11
i
got
baptized
in
a
church
of
christ
in
hicksville
i’m
a
cultural
jew
i
like
the
lower
east
side
humor
the
food
i
think
the
yiddish
language
is
terrifically
expressive
does
that
make
me
a
complete
jew
or
a
partial
jew?
i’m
not
really
sure[70]
