material
the

very
much

harry
doherty's
introduction
to
thin
lizzy

the
boys
are
back
in
town
click
here
to
buy
the
book
in
advance
via
amazon
this
thin
lizzy
book
has
come
through
an
awfully
long
gestation
period!
back
in
1977
phil
lynott
asked
me
to
write
the
book
and
interviews
were
conducted
in
toronto
where
i
spent
a
month
with
the
band
while
they
recorded
„bad
reputation
after
that
it
was
delayed
as
we
tried
to
continuously
update
it
during
the
subsequent
albums
but
phil
lynott
would
never
come
clean
with
his
increasing
drug
use
in
fact
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
once
„harry
i
don‚t
take
drugs
anymore‰
but
during
the
period
they
continued
to
prove
that
they
were
one
of
the
most
potent
rock
bands
in
the
world
growing
from
humble
roots
in
dublin
with
a
few
early
albums
that
verged
on
folkrock
and
then
recording
the
innovative
vagabonds
of
the
western
world
with
its
orchestral
guitars
fine
songs
and
arrangements
and
of
course
lynott‚s
unique
voice
but
it
was
after
the
band
lost
first
eric
bell
and
briefly
afterwards
gary
moore
that
they
really
came
into
their
own
in
what
has
been
called
the
golden
era
of
thin
lizzy
with
two
new
guitarists
scott
gorham
and
brian
robertson
they
set
upon
an
unprecedented
set
of
albums
and
touring
culminating
in
what
has
been
voted
the
best
live
album
of
all
time
live
and
dangerous
then
of
course
the
guitar
curse
struck
again
robertson
out
/
moore
back
in
/
moore
out
/
robertson
back
in
until
they
settled
on
blues
maestro
snowy
white
who
had
cut
his
teeth
with
pink
floyd
white
quit
after
two
albums
when
he
grew
tired
of
the
drug
use
by
lynott
and
gorham
leaving
the
door
open
for
another
young
guitarist
to
enter
john
sykes
was
known
primarily
as
a
heavy
metal
player
and
he
brought
that
heaviness
to
one
album
thunder
and
lightning
but
the
end
was
nigh
and
when
it
came
it
really
crashed
down
tragically
when
phil
died
i
finished
a
first
draft
of
the
book
on
the
proviso
that
i
would
be
able
to
tell
the
whole
story
and
if
any
one
person
from
the
band
or
their
families
objected
i
wouldn‚t
publish
it
it
was
all
very
dark
and
too
close
to
phil‚s
death
a
few
people
flinched
at
the
„warts
and
all‰
detail
including
scott
gorham
and
his
wife
christine
and
the
singer‚s
mother
philomena
so
at
last
we
have
the
full
story
the
tale
of
a
band
that
never
knew
when
to
stop
and
what
to
stop
this
is
thin
lizzy
from
beginning
to
end

thin
lizzy
book
teaser
#
2
from
a
shaky
start
in
dublin
in
the
late
sixties
thin
lizzy
was
to
become
one
of
the
20th
century‚s
great
rock
bands
the
story
of
their
ascent
is
wild
and
riveting
and
here
for
the
first
time
it
is
told
from
inside
the
band
by
their
guitarist
scott
gorham
and
rock
journalist
harry
doherty
who
toured
with
the
band
and
interviewed
them
extensively
from
the
early
days
there
are
also
contributions
from
road
crew
management
and
friends
in
1969
phil
lynott
and
brian
downey
were
approached
by
two
former
members
of
van
morrison's
band
to
form
a
new
group
thin
lizzy
was
born
a
group
notionally
led
by
lynott
that
would
see
a
dizzying
turnover
of
personnel
as
it
took
rock
and
the
life
style
that
came
with
it
to
new
levels
record
success
eluded
them
until
the
early
seventies
when
decca
released
their
whisky
in
the
jar‚
a
track
already
deemed
unrepresentative
of
the
band
by
thin
lizzy
themselves
it
became
a
huge
international
hit
and
the
albums
jailbreak
and
live
and
dangerous
carried
the
band
to
the
top
of
the

aged

but
by

was
already
a
legend
this
is
scott
gorham's
account
of
how
the
whole
remarkable
spectacle
played
out
10/18/2012
scott
gorham
tells
the
thin
lizzy
story
in
new
book!
one
of
the
defining
rock
groups
of
the
20th
century
thin
lizzy
began
life
in
dublin
in
1969
when
childhood
friends
phil
lynott
and
brian
downey
were
approached
by
two
former
members
of
van
morrison's
band
'them'
eric
wrixon
(keyboards)
and
eric
bell
(guitar)
now
for
the
first
time
their
story
is
told
by
guitarist
scott
gorham
and
rock
journalist
harry
doherty
who
interviews
and
toured
with
the
band
extensively
the
band's
story
is
told
by
the
people
who
were
involved
directly
including
former
guitarists
road
crew
management
family
and
friends
their
origins
in
dublin
as
a
three
piece
with
the
whiskey
in
the
jar
single
and
a
string
of
unsuccessful
but
highly
creative
albums
the
move
to
london
to
chase
the
dream
of
being
a
major
rock
band
the
chaotic
arrival
and
departures
of
various
members
including
eric
bell
(who
left
the
band
mid
concert)
irish
guitarist
gary
moore
brian
robertson
and
coauthor
scott
gorham
how
the
albums
jailbreak
and
boys
are
back
in
town
took
the
band
to
the
top
of
the
charts
just
as
they
were
to
become
bankrupt
includes
stories
of
the
band
on
the
road
the
drink
and
drugs
and
how
the
years
of
partying
drugtaking
and
non
stop
touring
eventually
took
its
toll
on
not
only
the
band
members
but
on
their
families
the
death
of
front
man
phil
lynott
and
their
legacy
following
his
death
harry
doherty
was
asked
to
write
the
book
in
1977
but
for
one
reason
or
another
(usually
to
do
with
drugs)
it
never
happened
however
scott
gorham
and
doherty
were
determined
that
a
quality
book
reflecting
the
story
of
the
band
and
their
highly
visual
impact
would
be
published
with
their
involvement
in
every
step
of
production
this
is
the
book
with
photographs
by
the
band's
official
photographer
that
have
not
be
seen
in
years
denis
o'regan
who
shot
the
band
as
official
photographer
and
may
photographs
from
the
inception
of
the
band
that
have
not
been
seen
before
the
book
is
published
on
november
12
and
preorders
can

thin
lizzy
announce
‘farewell’
to
touring

new
album
after
a
very
successful
2
year
run
with
the
current
line
up
thin
lizzy
have
made
a
decision
to
not
release
a
new
album
under
the
thin
lizzy
name
scott
gorham
out
of
respect
to
phil
lynott
and
the
legacy
he
created
we
have
decided
that
we
should
not
release
a
new
album
under
the
thin
lizzy
name
it
was
a
very
difficult
decision
as
we
put
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
into
rebuilding
the
thin
lizzy
brand
over
recent
years&nbsp
releasing
a
new
album
was
the
only
way
to
continue
this
success
we
all
know
how
much
phil
meant
to
this
band
and
the
fans
we
have
written
20
songs
that
we
all
feel
very
strongly
do
the
band
and
thin
lizzy
name
credit&nbsp
we
believe
phil
would
have
been
proud
of
them&nbsp
we
always
knew
a
new
record
was
a
touchy
subject
with
some
people
and
as
such
really
want
the
quality
of
these
songs
to
be
heard
by
everyone
without
any
judgment
or
prejudice
to
that
end
we
have
decided
not
to
release
these
songs
under
the
name
thin
lizzy&nbsp
we
want
to
thank
everyone
for
their
support
and
encouragement
over
the
years
and
to
all
our
fans&nbsp
we
will
release
this
material
soon
and
you
will
be
hearing
some
great
new
music
with
the
classic
thin
lizzy
sound
intact&nbsp
we
will
announce
future
plans
early
in
the
new
year
ricky
warwick
our
plan
always
was
to
put
out
new
music
to
keep
the
name
thin
lizzy
alive
and
fresh
with
all
the
band’s
fans
–
old
and
new
nobody
respects
phil
as
much
as
i
do
and
singing
his
songs
for
the
past
2
years
has
been
an
incredible
honor
and
something
i
will
never
forget
our
plan
was
to
always
keep
the
band
on
top
of
their
game
with
great
shows
and
great
production
to
honor
all
that
was
phil
lynott
and
his
iconic
body
of
work&nbsp
without
a
new
album
to
gain
new
press
and
keep
the
momentum
we
have
built
up
over
the
past
two
years
we
are
worried
the
thin
lizzy
brand
and
all
it
stands
for
will
diminish
to
a
point
we
would
never
want
to
see&nbsp
therefore
our
regular
touring
as
thin
lizzy
will
cease
at
the
end
of
this
year
after
our
european
tour
i
do
want
to
stress
that
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
we
will
never
play
together
again
as
thin
lizzy
if
there
are
options
for
other
parts
of
the
world
in
territories
that
this
line
up
has
never
visited
then
we
may
still
play
odd
shows
in
2013
and
beyond
if
people
want
to
see
us
from
all
the
band
and
associated
personnel
we
thank
everyone
of
our
fans

supporters
for
making
these
past
2
years
so
incredible
and
we
look
forward
to
seeing
you
all

positive

an
extraordinary

who
desperately
want

it's
great
that
