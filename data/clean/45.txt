forbid

coming
forward
as

victim
in

takes
couragethat's
why
it's
rarely
a

fawns

not

the
inconsistencies
in
her
story
i
realize
rape
accusations
are
touchy
but
you've
gotta
recognize
bullshit
when
you
smell
it
lying
about
being
raped
is
as
attention
whorish
and
low
as
it
gets
and
ultimately
makes
it
harder
for
real
victims
to
come
forward
when
stuff

not

how
it
got
to
be
such
a
big
deal
in

first

you
can't
just
blindly
believe
people
who
throw
out
rape
accusations
particularly
not
in
anonymous
comments
sections
and
directed
at
a
public
figure
i
know
it's
an
ubersensitive
topic
but
people
lie
on
the
internet
more
often
than
people
get
raped
fact
but
i
couldn't
care
less
about
conor's
reputation
it's
at
the
expense
of
actual
victims
when
