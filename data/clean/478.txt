gary
allan
hit
the
honky
tonk
circuit
in
his
native
southern
california
at
the
seasoned
age
of
12
playing
in
and
out
of
the
smoky
sweaty
bars
with
his
dad's
band
led
allan
to
follow
in
his
father's
footsteps
and
start
his
own
band
when
allan
returned
to
those
same
honky
tonks
with
his
own
combo
the
sound
was
true
bakersfield
country
merle
haggard
buck
owens
and
the
rest
allan
spent
most
of
his
twenties
honing
his
skills
as
a
new
traditionalist
country
singer
finally
in
1996
he
was
picked
up
by
the
decca
label
used
heart
for
sale
appeared
that
year
and
even
if
it
was
a
bit
timid
the
album
established
allan
as
a
talented
performer
with
plenty
of
potential
two
years
later
he
returned
with
it
would
be
you
this
time
out
allan
suffered
from
slick
nashville
production
which
winnowed
away
most
of
his
whiskeysoaked
barroom
charm
nevertheless
his
talent
shone
through
in
1999
decca
closed
its
doors
allan's
contract
was
picked
up
by
mca
which
released
his
smoke
rings
in
the
dark
later
that
year
the
album
combined
most
of
what
allan
did
best

dusty
honky
tonk
cracked
country
ballads

into
a
solid
effort
that
didn't
get
too
heavy
with
the
music
city
sheen
the
album
even
included
a
rousing
cover
of
the
del
shannon
classic
runaway
that
harked
back
to
allan's
younger
days
on
the
honky
tonk
circuit
with
2001's
alright
guy
an
accomplished
mix
of
driving
dusty
swagger
and
slowburn
croon
allan
proved
that
he
was
only
getting
better
with
age
its
single
man
to
man
became
the
singer's
first
number
one
hit
allan
toured
extensively
in
support
of
alright
guy
before
beginning
work
on
a
followup
album
and
when
see
if
i
care
appeared
in
september
2003
it
was
another
solid
set
of
bakersfieldderived
country
and
poignant
balladry
tough
all
over
a
top
ten
hit
arrived
in
2005
a
greatesthits
collection
was
issued
early
in
2007
followed
by
a
new
studio
project

hard
later
in
the
year
the
single
today
arrived
in
june
2009
and
debuted
on
the
chart
at
number
52
it
was
followed
by
the
album

the
pain

after

and
a
rest
