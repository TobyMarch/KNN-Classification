biography
cleveland
ohio
united
states
(1991
–
present)
bone
thugsnharmony
is
a
us
rap
group
formed
in
cleveland
ohio
united
states
in
1991
it
consists
of
rappers
krayzie
bone
wish
bone
fleshnbone
layzie
bone
and
bizzy
bone
perhaps
the
group’s
most
important
contribution
to
rap
is
their
speedy
harmonizing
flow
while
fast
rapping
has
always
had
a
niche
in
the
culture
bone
certainly
brought
the
style
to
the
forefront
in
addition
the
group’s
ability
to
harmonize
whilst
flowing
at
top
speeds
is
truly
remarkable
not
before
nor
since
has
a
rapper
or
rap
group
sung
an
a
cappella
tune
without
loss
of
street
cred
their
albums
have
varied
in
subject
material
with
1994’s
creepin
on
ah
come
up
being
heavily
influenced
by
the
gfunk
gangsta
rap
era
e
1999
eternal
the
group’s
most
successful
album
focused
primarily
on
violent
criminal
activity
but
also
showed
bone
exploring
themes
of
spirituality
and
the
introduction
of
the
group’s
trademark
“weed
songs”—
songs
devoted
entirely
to
smoking
weed
the
group’s
1997
album
the
art
of
war
saw
bone
further
explore
a
wide
variety
of
subjects
and
styles
with
even
more
focus
on
god
and
family
and
an
overall
more
ambient
mellow
sound
the
group
still
found
time
for
violent
lyrics
though
with
a
large
portion
of
the
album
dedicated
to
what
they
labeled
“clones”
who
claimed
bone
had
stolen
their
quicktongued
rapping
style
and
viceversa
2002’s
thug
world
order
album
saw
a
drastic
change
in
subject
matter
and
tone
for
the
group
the
lyrics
were
almost
completely
void
of
any
violence
