now
caleb
followill
mumbles
in
a
husky
drawl
on
a
recent
drizzly
london
evening
the
kings
of
leon
frontman
sits
in
the
corner
of
the
artdeco
bar
of
the
band's
fivestar
hotel
his
wearylumberjack
face
illuminated
by
candlelight
as
jazz
plays
i
jumped
off
the
top
of
that
fucking
yacht
again
the
accident
happened
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
on
a
break
between
shows
when
the
band
hit
golf
balls
into
the
sparkling
mediterranean
and
threw
a
toga
party
two
am
pitchblack
drunk
landed
on
my
butt
in
the
water
for
a
week
now
i
can
barely
sit
barely
stand
the
night
that
tore
the
kings
of
leon
apart
he
taps
on
his
leg
nervously
discussing
his
pillow
options
for
the
flight
home
to
nashville
the
doughnut
thing?
i'll
fucking
sit
on
it
i
don't
care
i
might
have
to
get
vic'ed
up
i
can't
sit
for
that
long
it
kills
me
a
friend
at
the
table
points
out
that
this
is
followill's
second
yacht
mishap
–
he
bruised
himself
on
a
boat
in
italy
in
2010
jetsetting
party
injuries
are
an
occupational
hazard
for
the
kings
who
are
back
on
tour
after
two
years
their
biggest
break
in
a
decade
the
last
time
they
started
a
tour
they
were
arguably
the
biggest
band
in
the
world
filling
arenas
on
the
strength
of
their
huge
popradio
hits
use
somebody
and
sex
on
fire
from
2008's
grammywinning
only
by
the
night
many
expected
the
followup
2010's
come
around
sundown
to
take
them
even
further
instead
it
sold
poorly
in
comparison
moving
731000
copies
about
a
third
of
what
night
sold
i
pretty
much
checked
out
for
that
record
caleb
says
now
the
band
ended
its
us
tour
early
canceling
26
dates
after
a
disastrous
dallas
gig
in
july
2011
now
the
kings
are
back
on
the
road
supporting
their
new
album
mechanical
bull
which
touches
on
all
of
the
group's
identities
of
the
past
decade
revvedup
garage
rockers
southernsoul
disciples
masters
of
arena
bombast
it
feels
good
to
be
the
fucking
underdog
says
bassist
jared
followill
we're
a
comeback
team
i'm
glad
we
took
that
time
off
and
there's
all
this
controversy
it
pushes
us
up
against
a
wall
and
we
work
best
that
way
caleb
who's
a
little
more
reserved
tells
me
he
just
listened
to
the
sequenced
new
album
on
the
plane
for
the
first
time
i
was
actually
kind
of
into
it
he
says
that
evening
the
followills
unwind
after
a
day
of
photo
shoots
and
british
press
interviews
at
one
of
their
favorite
restaurants
the
mayfair
seafood
hot
spot
scott's
you
don't
really
have
to
order
anything
says
longhaired
drummer
nathan
followill
choosing
two
big
pieces
of
dover
sole
sides
from
octopus
to
summer
squash
and
the
first
of
two
&pound178
bottles
of
australian
chardonnay
for
the
table
not
bad
eatin'
for
an
interview
says
caleb
the
oldest
followill
brothers
are
hardcore
foodies
–
this
month
they're
curating
a
food
festival
back
in
nashville
their
home
for
more
than
a
decade
where
they've
both
finished
home
renovations
to
accommodate
their
baby
daughters
nathan
describes
his
home
as
a
wooden
ufo
hovering
in
the
trees
(he
says
his
wife
singer
jessie
baylin
wants
to
get
it
in
an
architecture
magazine)
but
with
all
the
recent
activity
he's
spent
only
nine
days
there
