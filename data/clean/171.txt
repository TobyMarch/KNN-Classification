history
[edit]
formed
in
colchester
essex
england
in
1979
by
robbie
grey
(vocals)
gary
mcdowell
(guitar
vocals)
and
michael
conroy
(bass
vocals)[2]
modern
english
were
originally
known
as
the
lepers
the
group
expanded
to
modern
english
when
richard
brown
(drums)
and
stephen
walker
(keyboards)[2]
were
subsequently
added
to
the
lineup
of
the
band[1][2]
after
a
single
on
their
own
'limp'
label
in
1979
the
band
signed
to
4ad
the
following
year
with
two
further
singles
released
and
a
session
for
john
peel
recorded
before
the
band's
debut
album
mesh

lace
in
1981
the
band
in
the
early
days
showing
a
strong
joy
division
influence[3]
(mesh
and
lace
is
a
style
of
lingerie)[4]
a
second
peel
session
was
recorded
in
october
1981
the
followup
after
the
snow
(april
1982)
was
more
keyboardoriented
and
was
compared
to
simple
minds
and
duran
duran[3]
it
was
also
released
in
the
united
states
by
sire
records
the
following
year
where
it
reached
number
70
on
the
billboard
chart
and
sold
over
500000
copies[1][3]
grey
said
of
the
album
we
used
to
think
'god
we'll
never
make
a
pop
record
we're
artists!'
but
things
don't
always
turn
out
as
you
planned
and
when
you
actually
create
a
pop
record
it's
so
much
more
of
a
thrill
than
anything
else[5]
the
second
single
from
the
album
was
also
a
hit
in
the
us
the
jangly
i
melt
with
you
reaching
number
78[3]
when
he
reviewed
the
album
johnny
waller
of
sounds
described
the
track
as
a
dreamy
creamy
celebration
of
love
and
lust
which
deserves
to
be
showcased
on
as
12
single
all
by
itself
with
no
bside
while
his
colleague
tony
mitchell
described
it
as
suburban
amateurism
at
its
most
unrewarding[5]
the
band
relocated
to
new
york
city
and
worked
on
a
third
album
ricochet
days
which
again
made
the
top
100
in
the
us
after
which
the
band
left
4ad
and
were
solely
signed
to
sire
outside
the
uk
and
canada[3]
the
album
stop
start
(1986)
was
the
last
record
modern
english
record
released
by
sire
with
the
band
splitting
up
after
its
release
during
1983–84
time
grey
mcdowell
and
conroy
were
also
involved
with
this
mortal
coil[3]
robbie
grey
reformed
modern
english

mick
conroy
and
aaron
davidson
to
record
new
album
pillow
lips
released

the
album
featured
a
rerecorded
i
melt
with
you
which
was
released
as
a
single
and
saw
the
band
again
in
the
billboard
top
100[3]
the
band
split
up
for
a
second
time
in
1991
after
contractual
problems
with
tvt
with
grey
forming
engine
in

with
the
legal
issues
