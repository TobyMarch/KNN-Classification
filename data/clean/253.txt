it

ever
to
be
released
on

record
label
and
was
a
smashing
critical
and
commercial
success
it
reached
#1
on
billboard's

that

year
the
album
is
loaded

one
of

made
the
song
an
enduring
classic
with
this
heartfelt
version
all

dues
surely
must
be
paid
many
miles
and
many
tears
times
were
hard

now
they're
changing
you
should
know

bad

isn't

it's
not
artsy
this
is
bluesy

the
album
was
a
historically
significant
debut
and
one
of
the
true
classics
of
the
1970s

cd
bad
company's
selftitled
1974
debut
release
was
the
first
album
to
come
out
on
the

other
than

fortunately
it
proved
to
be
one
of
the
better

albums
of
the
decade
representing
good
old
fashioned
back
to
the
basics
rock
'n'
roll
can't
get
enough
with
its
catchy
guitar
lick
was
the
big
hit
off
of
the
album
but
my
fav
track
is
still
the
moody
title
track
(ie
bad
company
off
of
bad
company's
bad
company
album)
bad
company
was
a
supergroup
with
singer
paul
rodgers
and
drummer
simon
kirke
coming
from
free
guitarist
mick
ralphs
from
mott
the
hoople
and
boz
burrell
from
king
crimson
and
having
more
success
than
all
of
those
groups
put
together
with
this
first
album
following
the
led
zeppelin
model
strong
vocalist
rodgers
and
bluesbased
guitarist
ralphs
provide
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
music
giving
bad
company
its
signature
sound
meanwhile
do
you
think
ac/dc
got
their
idea
for
the
cover
of
back
in
black
from
this
one?
unfortunately
it
was
all
downhill
for
the
group
from
this
first
effort
with
straight
shooter
being
a
step
down
and
run
with
the
pack
continuing
the
slide
if
you
pick
up
their
hits
collection
10
from
6
(which
ignores
one
of
the
first
six
albums
anyhow)
you
will
get
the
four
best
tracks
from
this
one
which
is
the
only
album
from
bad
company
that

cd
this
album
has
to
be
played
loud!
if
you
have
neighbours
or
family
who
might
complain
play
it
through
headphones
or
play
it
in
the
car
but
to
do
this
album
justice
don't
play
it
quietly
in
the
background
the
drums
sound
particularly
good
on
this
remastered
edition
bad
company
almost
defined
stadium
rock
always
more
highly
regarded
in
the
us
than
in
their
native
england
the
band
was
formed
from
the
remnants
of
free
whom
many
believed
had
been
the
greatest
british
bluesrock
band
their
final
album
'heartbreaker'
(1972)
was
a
masterpiece
whose
qualities
have
become
increasingly
clear
over
the
years
i
remember
my
astonishment
at
the
time
that
the
sublime
(but
dead)
paul
kossoff
was
effectively
being
replaced
on
guitar
by
mick
ralphs
from
the
rather
lightweight
mott
the
hoople
and
who
was
this
boz
burrell
on
bass?
which
king
crimson
albums
had
he
actually
played
on?
it
turned
out
that
these
niggles
didn't
matter
what
held
bad
company
and
late
free
together
was
the
multitalented
paul
rodgers
he
didn't
just
have
arguably
the
strongest
voice
he
also
played
both
piano
and
a
great
guitar

all
the
guitars
and
solos
on
the
epic
free
single
'wishing
well'
for
example
are
his
he
continued
on
piano
and
2nd
guitar
for
the
debut
'bad
company'
which
for
me
is
their
equal
best
lp
alongside
the
followup
'straight
shooter'
the
title
track
is
my
favourite
it
magnificently
accentuates
the
image
of
outlaw
drifters
which
their
manager
peter
grant
(of
led
zeppelin
fame)
worked
hard
to
promote
it
would
seem
to
be
the
ideal
soundtrack
for
an
introspective
cowboy
western
but
i've
yet
to
see
the
movie
if
this
album
has
any
minor
flaws
or
a
song
that
isn't
quite
as
superb
as
the
rest
the
problem
can
be
resolved
by
playing
this
loud
or
when
drunk
or
at
any
time
when
you
want
to
enjoy
rather
than
be
supercritical
the
highquality
production
values
shine
through
on
this
goodtime
rock
cd
