industry
in
the
process
while
there
they
met
songwriter
angelo

the
rolling
stones
and
the
clash
in

nathan
and
caleb
had
received
interest
from
a
number
of
music
labels
and
eventually
signed
with
rca
records
which
initially
insisted
on
putting
a
band
together
for
the
two
of
them
in
an
interview
with
billboard
however
nathan
outlined
how
they
told
rca
we
don't
want

and
jaron
we're
going
to
buy
our
little
brother
a
bass
he's
a

caleb
will
teach
himself
the

matthew
played
guitar
when
he
was
10
and
i'll
play
the
drums
they
said
'all
right
we'll
come
down
in
one
month
and
see
you
guys'
later
in
the
interview
caleb
admitted
to
the
brothers
kidnapping
their
cousin
matthew
from
his
hometown
in
mississippi
for
him
to
join
the
band
they
told
his
mother
that
he
was
only
going
to
be
staying
for
a
week
but
never
allowed
him
to
return
home
we
locked
ourselves
in
the
basement
with
an
ounce
of
marijuana
and
literally
spent
a
month
down
there
my
mom
would
bring
us
food
down
added
nathan
and
at
the
end
of
that
month
the

people
came

at
this
stage
jared
was
only
16
years
old
and
had
not
yet
learned
to
play
the
bass
the
release
of
holy
roller
novocaine
gave
the
kings

a
significant
amount
of
exposure
receiving
a
4/5
star
rating
from
rolling
stone
magazine
all
of

also
produced
the

and
four
of

songs
would
later
be
released
on

the
versions
of
wasted
time
and
california
waiting
on
the
ep
differ
from
their
album
versions
however
with
the
first
having
a
more
tense
riff
and
different
vocal
style
than
the
same
track
