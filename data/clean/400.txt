biography
despite
a
huge
hit
single
in
the
mid'70s
(the
boys
are
back
in
town)
and
becoming
a
popular
act
with
hard
rock/heavy
metal
fans
thin
lizzy
are
still
in
the
pantheon
of
'70s
rock
bands
underappreciated
formed
in
the
late
'60s
by
irish
singer/songwriter/bassist
phil
lynott
lizzy
though
not
the
first
band
to
do
so
combined
romanticized
workingclass
sentiments
with
their
ferocious
twinlead
guitar
attack
as
the
band's
creative
force
lynott
was
a
more
insightful
and
intelligent
writer
than
many
of
his
ilk
preferring
sliceoflife
workingclass
dramas
of
love
and
hate
influenced
by
bob
dylan
bruce
springsteen
and
virtually
all
of
the
irish
literary
tradition
also
as
a
black
man
lynott
was
an
anomaly
in
the
nearly
allwhite
world
of
hard
rock
and
as
such
imbued
much
of
his
work
with
a
sense
of
alienation
he
was
the
outsider
the
romantic
guy
from
the
other
side
of
the
tracks
a
selfstyled
poet
of
the
lovelorn
and
downtrodden
his
sweeping
vision
and
writerly
impulses
at
times
gave
way
to
pretentious
songs
aspiring
to
clich&eacuted
notions
of
literary
significance
but
lynott's
limitless
charisma
made
even
the
most
misguided
moments
worth
hearing
after
a
few
early
records
that
hinted
at
the
band's
potential
lizzy
released
fighting
in
1975
and
the
band
(lynott
guitarists
brian
robertson
and
scott
gorham
and
drummer
brian
downey)
had
molded
itself
into
a
pretty
tight
recording
and
performing
unit
lynott's
thick
soulful
vocals
were
the
perfect
vehicle
for
his
tightly
written
melodic
lines
gorham
and
robertson
generally
played
lead
lines
in
harmonic
tandem
while
downey
(a
great
drummer
who
had
equal
amounts
of
power
and
style)
drove
the
engine
lizzy's
big
break
came
with
their
next
album
jailbreak
and
the
record's
first
single
the
boys
are
back
in
town
a
paean
to
the
joys
of
workingclass
guys
letting
loose
the
song
resembled
similar
odes
by
bruce
springsteen
with
the
exception
of
the
wholike
power
chords
in
the
chorus
with
the
support
of
radio
and
every
frat
boy
in
america
boys
became
a
huge
hit
enough
of
a
hit
as
to
ensure
record
contracts
and
media
attention
for
the
next
decade
(boys
is
now
used
in
beer
advertising)
never
the
toast
of
critics
(the
majority
writing
in
the
'70s
hated
hard
rock
and
heavy
metal)
lizzy
toured
relentlessly
building
an
unassailable
reputation
as
a
terrific
live
band
despite
the
lead
guitar
spot
becoming
a
revolving
door
(eric
bell
gary
moore
brian
robertson
snowy
white
and
john
sykes
all
stood
next
to
scott
gorham)
the
records
came
fast
and
furious
and
despite
attempts
to
repeat
the
formula
that
worked
like
a
charm
with
boys
lynott
began
writing
more
ambitious
songs
and
wrapping
them
up
in
vaguely
articulated
concept
albums
the
large
fan
base
the
band
had
built
as
a
result
of
boys
turned
into
a
smaller
yet
still
enthusiastic
bunch
of
hard
rockers
adding
insult
to
injury
was
the
rise
of
punk
rock
which
lynott
vigorously
supported
but
made
lizzy
look
too
traditional
and
too
much
like
tired
old
rock
stars
by
the
mid'80s
resembling
the
dinosaur
that
punk
rock
wanted
to
annihilate
thin
lizzy
called
it
a
career
lynott
recorded
solo
records
that
more
explicitly
examined
issues
of
class
and
race
published
a
nowoutofprint
book
of
poetry
and
sadly
became
a
victim
of
his
longtime
abuse
of
heroin
cocaine
and
alcohol
dying
in
1986
at
age
35
since
the
megapopular
alternative
rock
bands
of
the
mid'90s
appropriated
numerous
musical
messages
from
their
'70s
forebears
the
work
of
phil
lynott
and
thin
lizzy
will
hopefully
continue
to
be
seen
for
the
influential
rock

roll
it
is
in
1999
thin
lizzy
reunited
with
a
lineup
featuring
guitarists
scott
gorman
and
john
sykes
and
keyboardist
darren
wharton
which
was
rounded
out
by
a
journeyman
rhythm
section
of
bassist
marco
mendoza
and
drummer
tommy
aldridge
the
quintet's
ensuing
european
tour
produced
the
live
album
one
night
only
which
was
released
in
the
summer
of
2000
to
set

for
