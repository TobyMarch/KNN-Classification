had
a
live
argument
on
the
angie
martinez
show
on
hot
97
radio
50
cent
commented
that
koch
entertainment
was
a
graveyard
meaning
major
record
labels
would
not
work
with
their
artists[13]
cam'ron
then
ridiculed
the
record
sales
of
gunit
members
lloyd
banks
and
mobb
deep
by
stating
that
jim
jones
outsold
their
albums
despite
being

independent
label
and
that
his

the
diplomats
had
a
distribution
deal
from
several
labels[13]
both

50
cent
suggested
in

that
cam'ron
is
no
longer
able
to
lead
the
diplomats
and
that
jim
jones
should
take
his
place

and
curtis
pt
ii
in

he
makes
fun
of
50
cent's
appearance
calling
him
a
gorilla
with

teeth
50
cent
responded
by
releasing
hold
on
with
young
buck
since
2009
the
feud
between
the
two
has
seemed
to
calm
down
jim
jones
[edit]
during
this
time
cam'ron
was
not
speaking
to
his
fellow
diplomat
members
juelz
santana
and
jim
jones
leading
to
speculation
that
the
group
had
broken
up
however
despite
admitting
that
he
did
not
want
to
contact
jim
jones
he
said
that
he
had
no
hard
feelings
towards
him
in
an
interview
with
miss
info
cam'ron
said
i
still
haven't
spoken
to
jim
but
jim
ran
with
me
for
over
10
years
he
worked
hard
and
i
wish
him
the
best
of
luck
everybody
thinks
i'm
mad
at
jim
why
am
i
mad?
i
told
people
for
years
that
jimmy
was
gonna
be
a
star
so
its
better
on
my
resume
i
wish
him
the
best
[14]
but
after
three
years
of
not
speaking
cam'ron
and
jim
jones
mended
their
differences
in
april
2010
in

[edit]
after
it
was
evident
to
the
fans
that
the
diplomats
had
separated[citation

and
were
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
cam'ron
explained
in
an
interview
that
he
was
scared
for
juelz
santana
stating
he
was
addicted
to
the
drink
sizzurp
and
even
talked
to
his
mother
about
his
possible
addiction[citation

juelz
santana
responded
back
by
asking
why
cam'ron
would
say
false
accusations[citation
needed]
additionally
with
the
diplomats
seeming
to
be
broken
up
and
diminished
cam'ron
decided
to
sell
juelz
santana's
contract
from
diplomat
records
to
def
jam
records
for
$2000000[citation

however
juelz

said
there
were
no
hard
feelings
between
the
two
and
that
they
have
since
reconciled[citation

and

out
their
frustrations
on

to
trace
the
suspects
he
stated
that
he
does
not
know
who
shot
him[15]
on
april
22
2007
cam'ron
was
interviewed
on
60
minutes
as
part
of
a
piece
on
the
stop
snitchin'
movement[16]
he
also
stated
that
he
would
not
help
the
police
try
to
locate
the
shooter
saying
he
is
not
a
snitch
and
helping
the
police
would
probably
hurt
his
record
sales
he
stated
in
the
interview
because
with
the
type
of
business
i'm
in
it
would
definitely
hurt
my
business
and
the
way
that
i
was
raised
i
just
don't
do
that
i
was
raised
differently
not
to
tellit's
about
business
but
it's
still
also
a
code
of
ethics
when
asked
by
anderson
cooper
if
he
would
tell
the
police
if
a
serial
killer
was
living
next
to
him
cam'ron
replied
i
would
probably
move
but
would
not
inform
the
police
after
the
60
minutes
interview
aired
cam'ron
received
a
lot
of
media
criticism
for
his
statements[citation
needed]
cam'ron
later
issued
an
apology
for
his
comments
calling
them
an
error
in
judgement[16]
where
i
come
from
once
word
gets
out
that
you've
cooperated
with
the
police
that
only
makes
you
a
bigger
target
of
criminal
violence
that
is
a
dark
reality
in
so
many
neighborhoods
like
mine
across
america
i'm
not
saying
its
right
but
its
reality
and
it's
not
unfounded
there's
a
harsh
reality
around
violence
and
criminal
justice
in
our
inner
cities
cam'ron
has
had
contact
with
the
police
in
the
past
according
to
the
smoking
gun
new
york
police
department
records
indicate
that
giles
filed
a
police
report
with
police
after
he
was
assaulted
at
a
park
in
harlem
in
1999[17]
