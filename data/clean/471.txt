(1962
–
present)
troyal
garth
brooks
(born
february
7
1962
in
tulsa
oklahoma)
is
an
american
country
music
singer
songwriter
and
charity
director
brooks
was
a
phenomenal
musical
force
in
the
1990s
he
had
his
chart
breakthrough
in
1989
having
come
apparently
from
nowhere
and
was
an
immediate
commercial
success
lacking
the
tall
and
lanky
physical
appearance
typical
of
some
male
country
stars
he
successfully
integrated
pop
and
rock
elements
into
his
recordings
and
live
performances
he
soon
began
to
dominate
the
country
singles
and
country
albums
charts
and
quickly
crossed
over
into
the
mainstream
pop
arena
selling
records
like
no
one
else
in
country
music
ever
had
and
exposing
country
music
to
a
larger
audience
than
previously
thought
possible
brooks
enjoyed
one
of
the
most
successful
careers
in
popular
music
history
with
over
70
hit
singles
and
15
charted
albums
to
his
credit
and
over
115
million
albums
sold
in
the
us
alone
breaking
records
for
both
sales
and
concert
attendance
throughout
the
1990s
possibly
dissatisfied
and
looking
to
expand
his
career
boundaries
he
then
attempted
an
artistically
ambitious
(but
uncompleted)
multimedia
project
involving
a
fictitious
alter
ego
troubled
by
the
conflicts
between
career
and
family
the
year
after
the
decade
ended
garth
brooks
announced
his
retirement
from
recording
and
performing
thereby
disappearing
from
the
music
world
as
suddenly
as
he
