without
question
the
most
intelligent
artistic
rap
group
during
the
1990s
a
tribe
called
quest
jumpstarted
and
perfected
the
hiphop
alternative
to
hardcore
and
gangsta
rap
in
essence
they
abandoned
the
macho
posturing
rap
music
had
been
constructed
upon
and
focused
instead
on
abstract
philosophy
and
message
tracks
the
sucka
mc
theme
had
never
been
completely
ignored
in
hiphop
but
tribe
confronted
numerous
black
issues

date
rape
use
of
the
word
nigger
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
the
rap
industry

all
of
which
overpowered
the
occasional
game
of
the
dozens
just
as
powerful
musically
quest
built
upon
de
la
soul's
jazzrap
revolution
basing
tracks
around
laidback
samples
instead
of
the
playedout
james
brownfests
which
many
rappers
had
made
a
cottage
industry
by
the
late
'80s
comprised
of
qtip
ali
shaheed
muhammad
and
phife
a
tribe
called
quest
debuted
in
1989
and
released
their
debut
album
one
year
later
second
album
the
low
end
theory
was
quite
simply
the
most
consistent
and
flowing
hiphop
album
ever
recorded
though
the
trio
moved
closer
to
their
harder
contemporaries
on
1993's
midnight
marauders
a
spot
on
the
1994
lollapalooza
tour
showed
their
influence
with
the
alternative
crowd

always
a
bedrock
of
a
tribe
called
quest's
support

but
the
group
kept
it
real
on
1996's
beats
rhymes
and
life
a
dedication
to
the
streets
and
the
hiphop
underground
a
tribe
called
quest
was
formed
in
1988
though
both
qtip
(b
jonathan
davis)
and
phife
(b
malik
taylor)
had
grown
up
together
in
queens
qtip
met
dj
ali
shaheed
muhammad
while
at
high
school
and
after
being
named
by
the
jungle
brothers
(who
attended
the
same
school)
the
trio
began
performing
a
tribe
called
quest's
recording
debut
came
in
august
1989
when
their
single
description
of
a
fool
appeared
on
a
tiny
area
label
(though
qtip
had
previously
guested
on
several
tracks
from
de
la
soul's
3
feet
high
and
rising
and
later
appeared
on
deeelite's
groove
is
in
the
heart)
signed
to
jive
records
by
1989
a
tribe
called
quest
released
their
first
album
people's
instinctive
travels
and
the
paths
of
rhythm
one
year
later
much
like
de
la
soul
tribe
looked
more
to
jazz
as
well
as
'70s
rock
for
their
sample
base

can
i
kick
it?
plundered
lou
reed's
classic
walk
on
the
wild
side
and
made
it
viable
in
a
hiphop
context
no
matter
how
solid
their
debut
was
second
album
the
low
end
theory
outdid
all
expectations
and
has
held
up
as
perhaps
the
best
hiphop
lp
of
all
time
the
low
end
theory
had
included
several
tracks
with
props
to
hiphop
friends
and
a
tribe
called
quest
cemented
their
support
of
the
rap
community
with
1993's
midnight
marauders
the
album
cover
and
booklet
insert
included
the
faces
of
more
than
50
rappers

including
obvious
choices
such
as
de
la
soul
and
the
jungle
brothers

as
well
as
mild
surprises
like
the
beastie
boys
icet
and
heavy
d
though
impossible
to
trump
low
end's
brilliance
the
lp
offered
several
classics
(including
tribe's
most
infectious
single
to
date
award
tour)
and
a
harder
sound
than
the
first
two
albums
during
the
summer
of
1994
a
tribe
called
quest
toured
as
the
obligatory
rap
act
on
the
lollapalooza
festival
lineup
and
spent
a
quiet
1995
marked
only
by
several
production
jobs
for
qtip
returning
in
1996
with
their
fourth
lp
beats
rhymes
and
life
tribe
showed
signs
of
wear
it
was
a
good
album
but
proved
less
striking
than
the
low
end
theory
or
midnight
marauders
while
touring
in
support
of
1998's
the
love
movement
the
group
announced
their
impending
breakup
