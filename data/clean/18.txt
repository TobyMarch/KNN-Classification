the
thumbnail
summary
already
circulating
for
beck's
12th
fulllength
album
goes
like
this
it's
a
sequel
to
sea
change
the
brooding
2002
record
frequently
mentioned
as
his
masterpiece
this
is
useful
to
a
point
for
placing
morning
phase
in
a
general
neighborhood
but
like
so
many
descriptors
flying
around
it
doesn't
convey
much
about
the
work
itself
—
especially
since
sequel
is
often
shorthand
for
copy
which
this
most
certainly
is
not
to
get
a
sense
of
the
latest
turns
in
beck's
journey
go
directly
to
wave
one
of
several
pieces
from
morning
phase
built
on
the
entrancing
string
orchestrations
of
david
richard
campbell
the
singersongwriter's
father
here
you'll
find
no
conventional
strumming
no
weepy
pedalsteel
guitar
no
drums
at
all
—
just
low
strings
droning
in
support
of
a
disconsolate
almost
detached
vocal
through
the
somber
haze
comes
a
melody
defined
by
strangely
upturned
halfsteps
culminating
in
unsettling
repetitions
of
the
word
isolation
over
and
over
all
songs
considered
hear
beck
discuss
'morning
phase'
wave
has
little
in
common
with
what
most
think
of
as
pop
music
—
and
for
that
matter
with
what
most
think
of
as
beck
music
even
those
who
know
sea
change
will
be
surprised
by
the
song's
stark
sense
of
drama
in
a
recent
all
songs
considered
interview
beck
describes
the
long
interval
between
morning
phase
and
2008's
modern
guilt
as
a
process
of
rediscovery
he
was
contending
with
personal
issues
including
a
serious
back
injury
that
prevented
him
from
performing
and
when
he
found
it
difficult
to
write
for
himself
he
devoted
his
energy
to
covers
of
classic
records
and
writing
for
other
artists
(his
2012
song
reader
the
sheetmusic
folio
is
one
byproduct)
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
develop
the
new
album
he
says
because
he'd
been
challenging
himself
to
write
in
different
ways
—
and
didn't
always
believe
that
the
results
were
worth
sharing
of
course
new
thinking
sometimes
shows
up
disguised
in
familiar
rags
sure
morning
phase
resembles
the
earlier
work
in
that
it's
slow
and
stately
and
more
confessional
than
any
of
beck's
odelaystyle
sonic
jumbles
get
inside
the
new
songs
however
and
a
more
nuanced
perspective
emerges
there
are
surprisingly
approachable
settings
here
songs
that
start
with
humble
acoustic
guitar
and
grow
into
vast
and
dazzling
canyons
of
sound
the
rhythms
suggest
a
different
experience
of
slowness
a
patient
(or
maybe
just
grownup)
approach
to
the
pulse
likewise
the
lyrics
are
beamed
from
different
plateaus
before
when
beck
looked
at
how
the
concept
of
devotion
changes
in
the
charred
aftermath
of
a
romance
there
were
traces
of
bitterness
in
his
words
now
he
seeks
more
metaphysical
terrain
—
in
a
few
cases
it's
as
though
the
words
were
lifted
from
walking
mantras
or
transcribed
from
hypnotic
or
meditative
states
the
delivery
enhances
this
impression
even
the
most
wrenchingly
vulnerable
declarations
—
as
in
morning
wherein
he
observes
we
tore
it
all
down
and
buried
me
underneath
the
weight
—
are
rendered
with
yogic
calm
these
elements
make
the
latest
beck
creation
something
more
than
a
woundedheart
reprise
it's
a
glimpse
of
new
frontiers
in
letting
go
and
moving
on
told
by
someone
who
wasn't
thinking
quite
this
way
before
when
it
comes
to
an
artist
like
beck
one
of
the
most
restless
creators
of
his
generation
attempting
to
measure
artistic
growth
can
be
a
fool's
game
after
i
heard
morning
phase
a
few
times
i
went
back
to
sea
change
and
listened
specifically
to
the
rhythms
there
are
certainly
similarities
both
albums
have
a
few
majestic
slow
processionals
and
beautifully
sculpted
arrays
of
vocal
harmony
and
many
of
the
same
musicians
contribute
to
the
whole
i
was
struck
though
by
the
differences
how
the
crew
brings
a
sense
of
serenity
to
beck's
refrains
how
settled
and
selfless
everything
feels
now
how
the
musicians
breathe
together
in
the
vast
open
spaces
between
backbeats
of
a
song
like
unforgiven
making
music
involves
choosing
and
then
refining
an
approach
—
sometimes
making
little
tweaks
sometimes
abandoning
what
had
previously
been
sacred
what
you
hear
with
these
two
records
is
a
protracted
version
of
that
process
beck
and
his
supporting
cast
had
clear
ideas
about
playing
a
grand
slow
sad
song
in
2002
recognizing
that
fundamental
ideas
about
rhythm
have
changed
in
the
intervening
years
they
seek
out
new
ways
of
walking
a
similar
path
the
search
gives
these
songs
deep
resonance
today
releasing
an
album
containing
mostly
downtempo
songs
might
seem
like
a
quaint
oldfashioned
dare
or
a
gauntlet
—
until
that
is
you
hear
the
spellbinding
way
these
particular
songs
are
executed
here
slowness
isn't
ponderous
it's
a
virtue
a
gateway
to
contemplation
a
means
of
escaping
the
chatter
of
the
modern
world
still
no
matter
who's
at
the
wheel
13
slow
or
mediumtempo
songs
can
be
an
endurance
test
one
triumph
of
morning
phase
is
its
pacing
as
a
producer
beck
wisely
changes
the
color
palette
and
the
texture
from
one
track
to
the
next
and
after
a
few
relaxed
ballads
he
switches
things
up
with
a
crisp
traveling
tune
like
heart
is
a
drum
moving
at
a
(comparatively)
brisk
clip
beck
cruises
along
visiting
dark
selfdoubt
and
sunshiny
affirmation
and
places
on
the
emotional
spectrum
in
between
at
one
point
confessing
i
need
to
find
someone
to
show
me
how
to
play
it
slow
maybe
it's
ok
if
beck
doesn't
play
it
slow
all
the
time
though
because
there's
something
unexpectedly
profound
about
this
breezy
moment
as
he
contrasts
the
depths
of
despair
with
a
buoyant
almost
boundless
optimism
the
idea
to
which
he
keeps
returning
—
your
heart
is
a
drum
keeping
time
with
everyone
—
takes
on
deeper
meaning
on
the
page
it
looks
like
a
glib
slogan
but
in
the
song
it
becomes
almost
like
a
lifeline
that
abiding
almost
imperceptible
pulse
that
prevails

good
times
