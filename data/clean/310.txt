cd
deep
purple
is
the
heavy
metal
equivalent
of
yes
both
bands
sprung
up
in
the
late
1960's
flirted
for
awhile
with
the
idea
of
combining
classical
music
with
rock
had
a
relatively
brief
early
1970s
heydays
in
which
they
recorded
their
best
albums
had
some
latter
success
upon
reuniting
in
the
mid1980s
and
have
since
faded
into
a
long
and
uninspired
twilight
that
has
added
little
to
their
legacies
like
yes
most
of
deep
purple's
best
music
resides
on
a
handful
of
albums
(machine
head
made
in
japan
perfect
strangers)
and
any
anthology
album
simply
sweeps
the
other
bits
and
pieces
together
into
one
package
as
single
disc
anthologies
go
the
very
best
of
deep
purple
is
as
tightly
packed
as
it
could
be
(just
a
tad
over
75
minutes
of
music)
and
while
you
can
always
quibble
about
track
selection
around
the
margains
on
a
disc
lke
this
(i'd
have
chosen
the
title
track
of
the
band's
1984
comeback
album
perfect
strangers
for
example)
all
of
the
band's
best
known
tunes
are
here
including
smoke
on
the
water
space
truckin'
hush
woman
from
tokyo
knocking
at
your
back
door
it's
also
no
accident
that
about
12
of
the
15
tunes
included
were
recorded
by
purple's
classic
lineup
with
both
vocalist
ian
gillan
and
guitarist
ritchie
blackmore
without
either
one
or
both
of
them
the
purples
are
little
better
than
just
another
arena
rock
band
the
cd
booklet
contains
lengthy
liner
notes
and
photographs
from
various
periods
in
the
band's
history
overall
a
decent
single
disc
anthology
album
that
will
be
of
most
interest
to
the
casual
fan

bertin
formataudio
cd
well
yes
and
no!
there're
a
couple
of
things
that
you
should
know
about
this
release
first
the
liner
notes
claim
that
this
is
the
first
collection
of
the
cd
era
which
is
not
entirely
true
since
the
previous
deepest
purple
compilation
was
already
available
(however
the
remastering
is
most
welcome!)
and
that's
probably
my
only
complaint
(i
would
actually
rate
this
item
with
4
and
a
half
stars
but
since
the
format
won't
allow
me
to
do
that)
about
this
compilation
it
offers
very
little
additional
material
only
3
songs
that
were
not
included
in
deepest
its
title
notwithstanding
this
cd
is
a
greatest
hits
compilation
and
not
(necessarily)
the
very
best
but
semantics
aside
there
are
a
couple
of
exceptions
of
songs
that
were
not
issued
as
singles
(space
trucking
and
child
in
time
for
instance)
i
originally
didn't
care
much
for
the
covers
of
kentucky
woman
and
hush
but
i
understood
their
inclusion
here
since
those
were
the
first
hits
the
band
scored
with
in
the
us
(the
territory
this
cd
is
meant
for)
but
the
tunes
eventually
grew
on
me
leading
me
to
get
their
first
3
records
it's
a
shame
that
no
additional
material
from
the
band's
second
coming
in
the
80's
could
be
included
though
but
that
is
simply
a
record
company
issue
the
latter
part
of
purple's
catalog
was
released
with
a
different
record
label
in
the
end
this
is
a
great
compilation
and
if
you
want
to
have
a
taste
of
some
of
purple's
best
material
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
however
if
you
like
me
were
looking
for
a
more
comprehensive
package
including
music
from
all
the
lineups
(including
the
criminally
underrated
mk
iv
completely
ignored
here)
you
might
be
a
bit
disappointedyou
can
always
get
the
boxset
shades
but
that's
a
different
tale
but
casual
fans
looking
for
nothing
but
the
hits
rejoice
here
they
are!!!
and
for
roughly
8
bucks
you
can't
really
ask
for
more

cd
this
is
not
bad
for
a
single
disc
collection
of
dp
but
adding
another
70+minute
disc
would
have
been
a
better
idea
there's
alway's
going
to
be
people
who
feel
like
there
favorite
song
should
have
been
included
and
that
might
just
solve
the
problem
even
so
this
compilation
has
their
highest
charting
hits
but
i
and
many
other
fans
don't
like
the
hits
as
much
as
their
other
fan
favorites
i
kind
of
wish
that
they
could
have
left
off
smoke
on
the
water
because
it's
overplayed
way
too
much
on
the
classic
rock
stations
and
i've
never
really
warmed
up
to
space
truckin'
even
though
it's
from
a
great
album
machine
head
it
would
have
been
great
if
they
could
have
included
pictures
from
home
from
machine
head
and
mule
from
fireball
but
if
your
just
a
hitman
like
my
friend
randy
was
than
this
best
of
compilation
might
be
right
up
your
alley
still
if
you
want
a
more
comprehensive
survey
of
this
great
band
then
i
would
suggest
getting
their
boxed
set
i
guess
it
may
seem
like
i've
been
in
a
cave
but
i
didn't
know
till
about
2
years
ago
that
steve
morse
has
been
their
guitarist
since
1994
i'd
really
like
to
see
him
play
their
new
and
old
stuff
i'm
sure
he
can
do
it
without
much
difficulty
