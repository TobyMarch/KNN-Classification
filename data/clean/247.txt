(1973–1982)
[edit]
there
was
a
rumor
that
singer
paul
rodgers
was
so
enamored
with
the
jeff
bridges
film
bad
company
that
he
chose
to
name
his
band
after
it
but
rodgers
in
an
interview
with
spinnercom
explained
that
the
idea
came
from
a
book
of
victorian
morals
that
showed
a
picture
of
an
innocent
kid
looking
up
at
an
unsavory
character
leaning
against
a
lamppost
the
caption
read

however
the

grew
increasingly
disenchanted
with
playing
large

in
addition
peter
grant
lost
interest
in
the
group
and
in
management
in
general
after
led
zeppelin
drummer
john
bonham
died
on
25
september
1980
in
the
words
of
simon
kirke
peter
was
definitely
the
glue
which
held
us
all
together
and
in
his
absence
we
came
apart[3]
a
threeyear
hiatus
from
the
studio
ended
with
the
release
of
rough
diamonds
in
1982
this
would
be
the
sixth
and
final
lp
in
the
group's
original
incarnation
until
four
new
songs
were
recorded
in
1998
the
album
was
the
worst
selling
bad
company
album
of
those
that
had
paul
rodgers
as
the
front
man
the
album
peaked
at
no&nbsp26
and
featured
electricland
(#74)
that
reached
no&nbsp2
on
the
newly
created
hot
mainstream
rock
tracks
chart
after
the
release
of
rough
diamonds
they
disbanded
mick
ralphs
said
paul
wanted
a
break
and
truthfully
we
all
needed
to
stop
bad
company
had
become
bigger
than
us
all
and
to
continue
would
have
destroyed
someone
or
something
from
a
business
standpoint
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
do
but
paul's
instinct
was
absolutely
right[4]
despite
being
famous
for
their
live
shows
packing
the
largest
stadiums
for
almost
a
decade
bad
company
did
not
release
an
official
live
album
of
performances
from
this
time
period
until
the
2006
album
live
in
albuquerque
1976
the
recordings
were
made
by
mick
ralphs
who
regularly
taped
the
group's
shows
and
utilized
the
tapes
to
critique
the
band's
performances
bootlegs
of
bad
company's
live
performances
from
this
period
were
also
available
including
boblingen
live
(1974)

the
brian
howe
era
(1984–1994)
[edit]
in
1984
mick
ralphs
and
simon
kirke
decided
to
reteam
for
a
new
project
their
label
atlantic
records
however
insisted
they
resume
the
bad
company
name
but
paul
rodgers
was
already
engaged
with
a
new
supergroup
called
the
firm
with
rodgers
gone
the
remaining
two
members
partnered
with
exted
nugent
vocalist
brian
howe
as
the
new
lead
singer
in
addition
they
hired
steve
price
as
the
new
bass
player
and
greg
dechert
(exuriah
heep)
on
keyboards
howe's
vocal
style
brought
more
of
a
poprock
sound
to
the
band
which
atlantic
records
looking
to
bring
the
band
back
up
to
arena
status
was
looking
for
after
declining
turnouts
to
previous
live
performances
and
the
dismal
sales
of
rough
diamonds
the
band
hired
foreigner
producer
keith
olsen
to
produce
the
new
lineup's
initial
album
1986's
fame
and
fortune
reflecting
the
musical
style
of
the
mid80s
the
album
was
laden
with
keyboards
unlike
previous
bad
company
albums
and
was
modestly
commercially
successful
the
single
this
love
managed
to
reach
no&nbsp85
on
the
singles
charts
but
was
not
the
success
the
band
hoped
for
but
things
were
about
to
change
in
1987
dechert
was
dropped
from
the
lineup
as
the
group
decided
not
to
play
up
the
keyboards
in
their
sound
as
much
they
toured
that
year
supporting
deep
purple
for
the
next
howeera
album
1988's
dangerous
age
the
band
replaced
olsen
with
producer
terry
thomas
who
got
rid
of
most
of
the
keyboards
and
returned
the
band
to
a
guitardriven
sound
thomas
also
added
small
amounts
of
keyboards
as
well
as
rhythm
guitars
and
backing
vocals
and
wrote
most
of
the
songs
with
the
band

fared
better
than
its
predecessor

conclusion
of
the

cd
while
paul
cullen
was
recruited
for
live
shows
mick
ralphs
who
was
taking
care
of
personal
and
family
matters
sat
out
for
most
of
the
holy
water
tour
although
he
did
perform
on
the
album
ralphs
was
replaced
on
the
road
and
in
the

by
excrawler
guitarist
geoffrey

5
grossing
tours
of

yankees
that
year
was
one
in
which
saw
many
other
rock
acts
facing
a
downturn
in
concert
attendance
brought
on
by
rising
ticket
prices
and
economic
recession
it
was
widely
rumored
all
summer
that

which
he
helped
revive
3
years
earlier
had
been
bickering
over
financial
matters
howe

rumored
to
be
leaving
the
band
and
exkansas
singer
steve
walsh
was
to
take
over
for
the
remainder
of
the
tour
easier
said
than
done
atlantic
records
did
not
agree
given
the
success
of
holy
water
and
howe's
extraordinary
vocal
ability
and
he
was
asked
to
stay
on
the
final
studio

the
band
howe
left
the
band
in
1994
regarding
his
departure
from
the
band
howe
stated
leaving
bad
company
was
not
a
difficult
decision
it
had
got
to
the
point
where
nobody
was
contributing
anything
to
songwriting
and
quite
frankly
the
band
was
getting
very
very
sloppy
live
i
quite
simply
along
with
terry
thomas
got
tired
of
doing
all
the
work
and
then
getting
nothing
but
resentment
for
it
from
mick
and
simon[5]
