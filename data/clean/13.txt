allamerican
rejects
vocalist/bassist
tyson
ritter
and
guitarist
nick
wheeler
both
hail
from
stillwater
ok
where
the
pair
first
embraced
music
as
an
appealing
diversion
from
the
hohum
life
of
smalltown
america
citing
such
influences
as
ac/dc
def
leppard
and
bon
jovi
they
formed
the
emopop
group
allamerican
rejects
in
2000
while
both
members
were
still
in
high
school
maintaining
a
full
lineup
proved
to
be
difficult
however
so
ritter
and
wheeler
employed
drum
loops
and
preprogrammed
rhythm
tracks
during
their
early
performances
an
arrangement
they
then
reprised
on
their
selftitled
debut
originally
released
on
the
doghouse
label
in
october
2002
the
poppy
record
was
later
reissued
to
a
national
audience
by
dreamworks
the
band
scored
a
hit
with
the
effervescent
single
swing
swing
which
attracted
attention
from
interscope
records
and
ultimately
landed
the
allamerican
rejects
on
the
label's
prized
roster
move
along
the
band's
sophomore
album
(and
first
for
interscope)
was
released
in
july
2005
it
also
marked
the
official
debut
of
mike
kennerty
(guitar)
and
chris
gaylor
(drums)
both
of
whom
had
joined
the
band
in
2002
after
the
completion
of
the
rejects'
eponymous
debut
like
its
predecessor
move
along
went
platinum
with
three
singles
(dirty
little
secret
move
along
and
it
ends
tonight)
enjoying
chart
success
in
the
us
and
abroad
recording
sessions
for
a
third
album
commenced
in
mid2007
and
ran
through
the
following
year
causing
the
allamerican
rejects
to
cancel
their
scheduled
warped
tour
performances
(as
well
as
a
string
of
shows
with
simple
plan)
when
the
world
comes
down
ultimately
arrived
in
december
2008
preceded
by
the
single
gives
you
hell
the
band
hit
the
road
in
support
of
the
album
but
were
forced
to
cut
their
tour
short
in
2009
after
ritter
was
confined
to
a
wheelchair
after
getting
knee
surgery
the
band
got
back
to
writing
the
following
year
working
with
producer
greg
wells
on
their
fourth
album
kids

arrived
