an
older
brother
george[6]
seger's
father
a
medical

for
the
ford
motor
company
played
several
instruments
and
seger
was
exposed
to
music
from
an
early
age[6]
seger
was
also
exposed
to
frequent
arguments
between
his
parents
that
disturbed
the
neighborhood
at
night[6]
in
1956
when
seger
was
10
years
old
his
father
abandoned
the
family
and
moved
to
california[6]
the
remaining
family
soon
lost
their
comfortable
middleclass
status
and
struggled
financially[6]
seger
attended
tappan
junior
high
school
(ann
arbor
michigan)
(now
tappan
middle
school)
and
graduated
from
pioneer

ran
track
and
field
in
high
school
seger
also
went
to
lincoln
park
high
school
for
a
year[citation

as
far
as
his
early
musical
inspirations
are
concerned
seger
has
stated
little

he
was
the
first
one
that
really
got

of
course
elvis

[edit]
bob
seger
arrived
on
the
detroit
music
scene
in
1961
fronting
a
threepiece
band
called
the
decibels
the
band
included
seger
on
guitar
piano
keyboards
and
vocals
pete
stanger
on
guitar
and
hb
hunter
on
drums
all
of
the
members
attended
ann
arbor
high
the
decibels
recorded
an
acetate
demo
of
a
song
called
the
lonely
one
at
del
shannon's
studio
in
1961
as
well
as
being
seger's
first
original
song
the
lonely
one
was
seger's
first
song
to
be
played
on
the
radio
airing
only
once
on
an
ann
arbor
radio
station[6][8]
after
the
decibels
disbanded
seger
joined
the
town
criers
a
fourpiece
band
with
seger
on
lead
vocals
john
flis
on
bass
pep
perrine
on
drums
and
larry
mason
on
lead
guitar
the
town
criers
covering
songs
like
louie
louie
began
gaining
a
steady
following
meanwhile
seger
was
listening
to
james
brown
and
said
that
for
him
and
his
friends
live
at
the
apollo
was
their
favorite
record
following
its
release
in
1963
seger
was
also
widely
influenced
by
the
music
of
the
beatles
once
they
hit
american
shores
in
1964
in
general
he
and
local
musician
friends
such
as
future

frey
bought
into
the

of

pop
and
rock
radio
with
its
hookdriven
hits
he
later
recalled
he
and
frey
thinking
at
the
time
you’re
nobody

you
can’t
get

doug
brown

the
omens
[edit]
as
the
town
criers
began
landing
more
gigs
bob
seger
met
a
man
named
doug
brown
backed
by
a
band
called
the
omens
seger
joined
doug
brown

the
omens
who
presumably
had
a
bigger
following
than
the
town
criers
while
doug
brown
was
the
primary
lead
vocalist
for
the
group
seger
would
take
the
lead
on
some
songs—covering
rb
numbers[6]
it
was
with
this
group
that
seger
first
appeared
on
an
officially
released
recording
the
1965
single
tgif
backed
with
first
girl
credited
to
doug
brown
and
the
omens
seger
later
appeared
on
doug
brown
and
the
omens'
parody
of
barry
sadler's
song
ballad
of
the
green
berets
which
was
retitled
ballad
of
the
yellow
beret
and
mocked
draft
dodgers
soon
after
its
release
sadler
and
his
record
label
threatened
brown
and
his
band
with
a
lawsuit
and
the
recording
was
withdrawn
from
the
market[10]
while
bob
was
a
member
of
the
omens
he
met
his
longtime
manager
edward
punch
andrews
who
at
the
time
was
partnered
with
dave
leone
running
the
hideout
franchise
which
consisted
of
two
clubs
where
local
acts
would
play
and
a
smallscale
record
label
seger
began
writing
and
producing
for
other
acts
that
punch
was
managing
such
as
the
mama
cats
and
the
mushrooms
(with
frey)
seger
and
doug
brown
were
then
approached
by
punch
and
leone
to
write
a
song
for
the
underdogs
another
local
band
who
recently
had
a
hit
with
a
song
called
man
in
the
glass
seger
contributed
a
song
called
east
side
story
which
ultimately
proved
to
be
a
failure
for
the
underdogs[10]
the
last
heard
[edit]
seger
decided
to
record
east
side
story
himself
and
officially
left
the
omens
(though
he
did
retain
doug
brown
as
a
producer)
as
bob
seger
and
the
last
heard
seger
released
his
version
of
the
song
with
hideout
records
in
january
1966
and
it
became
his
first
big
detroit
hit
the
single
(backed
with
east
side
sound
an
instrumental
version
of
east
side
story)
sold
50000
copies
mostly
in
the
detroit
area
and
led
to
a
contract
with
cameoparkway
records
though
the
name
the
last
heard
originally
referred
to
the
collection
of
omens
and
town
criers
who
recorded
east
side
story
with
seger
it
soon
became
the
name
of
seger's
permanent
band
which
consisted
of
former
town
crier
pep
perrine
on
drums
carl
lagassa
on
guitar
and
dan
honaker
on
bass
following
east
side
story
the
group
released
four
more
singles
the
james
browninspired
holiday
single
sock
it
to
me
santa
the
dylanesque
persecution
smith
vagrant
winter
and
perhaps
the
most
notable
heavy
music
released
in
1967
heavy
music
which
sold
even
more
copies
than
east
side
story
had
potential
to
break
out
nationally
when
cameoparkway
suddenly
went
out
of
business
it
was
actually
a
top
100
hit
in
canada
where
it
topped
out
on
the
national
rpm
charts
at
#82
in
the
us
it
just
missed
the
hot
100
peaking
on
the
bubbling
under
chart
at
#103
the
song
would
stay
in
seger's
live
act
for
many
years
to
come
the
bob
seger
system
[edit]
after
cameoparkway
folded
seger
and
punch
began
searching
for
a
new
label
in
the
spring
of
1968
bob
seger

the
last
heard
signed
with
major
label
capitol
records
turning
down
motown
records
who
offered
more
money
than
capitol
seger
felt
that
capitol
was
more
appropriate
for
his
genre
than
motown[6]
capitol
changed
the
name
of
the
band
to
the
bob
seger
system
in
the
transition
between
labels
guitarist
carl
lagassa
left
the
band
and
keyboard
player
bob
schultz
joined
the
system's
first
single
with
capitol
was
the
antiwar
message
song
2
+
2
=
?
which
reflected
a
marked
change
in
seger's
political
attitudes
from
the
ballad
of
the
yellow
beret
the
single
was
again
a
hit
in
detroit
and
hit
number
1
on
radio
stations
in
buffalo
new
york
and
orlando
florida[11]
but
went
unnoticed
almost
everywhere
else
and
failed
to
chart
nationally
in
the
us
the
single
did
however
make
the
canadian
national
charts
peaking
at
#79
the
second
single
from
the
bob
seger
system
was
ramblin'
gamblin'
man
it
was
a
major
hit
in
michigan
but
it
also
became
seger's
first
national
hit
peaking
at
#17
the
song's
success
led
to
the
release
of
an
album
of
the
same
title
in
1969
the
ramblin'
gamblin'
man
album
reached
#62
on
the
billboard
pop
albums
chart
it
should
be
noted
that
glenn
frey
(eagles)
had
his
first
studio
gig
singing
backup
on
ramblin'
gamblin'
man
seger
was
unable
to
follow
up
this
success
for
the
next
album
singer/songwriter
tom
neme
joined
the
system
ultimately
writing
and
singing
the
majority
of
the
tunes
featured
for
which
the
group
was
heavily
criticized
the
album
called
noah
failed
to
chart
at
all
leading
seger
to
briefly
quit
the
music
industry
and
attend
college
he
returned
the
following
year
and
put
out
the
system's
final
album
1970's
mongrel
this
time
without
tom
neme
bob
schultz
left
the
band
as
well
being
replaced
by
dan
watson
mongrel
with
the
powerful
single
lucifer
was
considered
to
be
a
strong
album
by
many
critics
and
detroit
fans
but
failed
to
do
well
commercially
solo
[edit]
after
mongrel
failed
to
liveup
to
the
success
of
ramblin'
gamblin'
man
the
system
dissipated
for
a
short
period
of
time
following
the
breakup
seger
had
ambitions
to
be
a
oneman
act[12]
in
1971
seger
released
his
first
solo
album
the
allacoustic
brand
new
morning
the
album
was
a
commercial
failure
and
led
to
seger's
departure
from
capitol
records[8][13]
seger
having
regained
an
eye
for
bands[12]
began
playing
with
the
duo
teegarden

van
winkle
who
in
1970
had
a
hit
single
with
god
love
and
rock

roll
together
they
recorded
smokin'
op's
released
on
punch
andrews'
own
palladium
records
the
album
mainly
consisted
of
covers
spawning
a
minor
hit
with
a
version
of
tim
hardin's
if
i
were
a
carpenter
(#76
us)
though
it
did
feature
someday
a
new
seger
original
and
a
rerelease
of
heavy
music
the
album
reached
180
on
the
billboard
200
after
spending
the
better
part
of
1972
touring
with
teegarden

van
winkle
seger
left
the
duo
to
put
together
a
new

renowned
group
of
session
musicians
who
had
recorded
with
the
likes
of
j
j
cale
and
aretha
franklin[14]
according
to
seger
there
was
a
financial
misunderstanding
with
the
musicians
they
offered
to
record
him
for
$1500
a
side
which
he
took
to
mean
$1500
per
album
side
when
he
found
out
that
they
meant
$1500
per
song
he
left
after
recording
three
songs
but
resolved
to
work
with

in

he

and
recorded
living

for

of

seger
was
no
longer
as
prolific
and
several
years
elapsed
before
his
next
studio
album
like

rock
emerged
in
the
spring
of
1986
the
fastpaced
american
storm
was
another
top
20
single
aided
by
a
popular
music
video
featuring
actress
lesley
ann
warren
and
like
a
rock
followed
reaching
#12
on
billboard's
hot
100
later
it
would
become
familiar
to
many
americans
through
its
association
with
a
longrunning
chevrolet
ad
campaign
(something
seger
explicitly
chose
to
do
to
support
struggling
american
automobile
workers
in
detroit)[20]
seger's
19861987
american
storm
tour
was
his
selfstated
last
major
tour
playing
105
shows
over
9
months
and
selling
almost
15
million
tickets
like
a

eventually
sold
over
3
million
copies
although
it
has
never
been
certified

platinum
the
following
year
seger's
shakedown
a
somewhat
uncharacteristic
song
off
the
1987
film
beverly
hills
cop
ii's
soundtrack
became
his
first
and
only
#1
hit
on
the
pop
singles
chart
the
song
had
originally
been
intended
for
seger's
fellow
detroiter
glenn
frey
but
when
he
lost
his
voice
just
prior
to
the
recording
session
frey
called
in
seger
to
take
his
place
seger
changed
the
verses
of
the
song
but
kept
the
chorus
the
same
the
song
would
earn
seger
an
academy
award
nomination
as
cowriter
in
the
best
original
song
category
the
following
year
later
