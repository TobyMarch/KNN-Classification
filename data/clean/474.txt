cd
garth
brooks'
selftitled
debut
album
is
a
strong
one
garth's
debut
single
the
rodeo
song
much
too
young
to
feel
this
damn
old
was
my
favorite
song
by
garth
until
the
dance
superseded
it
the
dance
which
on
the
surface
sounds
like
a
relationship
song
but
is
actually
a
celebration
of
life
was
written
by
garth's
friend
tony
arata
who
would
go
on
to
write
some
other
great
songs
which
garth
recorded
the
love
ballad
if
tomorrow
never
comes
and
the
honkytonk
song
not
counting
you
were
the
other
hit
songs
from
garth
brooks
other
highlights
are
everytime
that
it
rains
nobody
gets
off
in
this
town
and
garth's
remake
of
the
classic
charley
pride
song
i
know
one
garth
went
on
to
make
quite
a
few
great
albums
but
his
debut
album
in
my
opinion
is
a
classic

cd
this
was
garth's
first
cd
and
an
outstanding
debut
for
a
man
who
would
become
one
of
music's
most
popular
singer/songwriters
he
was
27
at
the
time
but
looks
like
a
kid
on
the
cover
photo
and
he
has
described
this
cd
as
innocent
which
in
some
ways
it
is
there
is
a
freshness
to
the
music
and
a
sweetness
in
the
lyrics
the
songs
much
too
young
(taylor/brooks)
was
garth's
first
hit
single
and
is
about
a
rodeo
cowboy
the
white
line's
getting
longer
and
the
saddle's
getting
cold
and
is
one
of
the
terrific
story
songs
on
this
cd
not
counting
you
is
one
of
the
few
uptempo
songs
and
is
the
only
one
penned
by
garth
alone
the
words
are
a
clever
example
of
writing
in
negatives
there's
no
exception
to
the
rule
/
i've
never
been
nobody's
fool
/
i've
never
lost
at
love
not
counting
you
it
was
the
second
of
the
singles
from
this
cd
and
one
of
my
favorite
tracks
two
others
that
were
singles
have
become
signature
songs
for
garth
if
tomorrow
never
comes
(blazy/brooks)
a
beautiful
meaningful
ballad
and
the
dance
(tony
arata)
another
lovely
ballad
with
bobby
wood
on
piano
shining
in
a
truly
wonderful
musical
arrangement
everytime
that
it
rains
(stefl/england/brooks)
and
through
the
dance
we
both
stumbled
and
with
the
buttons
we
fumbled
and
cowboy
bill
(bastian/berghoff)
are
two
more
story
songs
that
draw
one
in
with
their
welltold
tales
and
garth's
great
interpretations
this
is
intelligent
finely
crafted
highquality
country
music
and
garth's
smooth
and
rich
vocals
and
the
superb
musicianship
of
his
band
makes
this
one
of
the
most
auspicious
firsts
i've
ever
heard
and
an
essential
cd
in
my
collection

cd
garth
brooks'
selftitled
1989
debut
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
release
from
the
multimillion
selling
country
superstar
none
of
the
ten
tracks
can
be
mistaken
for
anything
but
country
if
his
popcrossover
experiment
chris
gaines
made
you
sick
and
longing
for
the
country
garth
just
listen
to
this
album
and
remember
why
country
fans
fell
in
love
with
him
and
his
music
you
probably
already
know
the
hit
singles
if
tomorrow
never
comes
the
dance
and
much
too
young
(to
fell
this
damn
old)
and
the
album's
other
seven
songs
live
up
to
the
same
standards
these
do
especially
not
counting
you
alabama
clay
and
every
time
that
it
rains
songs
that
if
released
as
singles
would
undoubetly
gone
straight
to
no
1
if
you
had
to
choose
one

cd
i
cannot
possibly
say
enough
good
about
garth
brooks
his
music
has
gotten
me
through
the
tough
times
and
tought
me
appreciation
of
many
things
that
i
took
for
granted
his
songs
speak
of
the
important
things
in
life
which
many
overlook
the
dance
will
always
be
my
fovorite
song
and
i
hope
it
is
played
at
my
funeral
it
is
exactly
how
i
feel
about
life
and
kept
me
hanging
on
so
many
times
from
this
album
i
also
gained
an
appreciation
of
the
classics
like
chris
ledoux
god
bless

though
his
debut
cd
has
been
my
favorite
in
fact
i
think
it's
one
of
the
best
country
cd's
i've
ever
heard
this
cd's
two
biggest
hits
were
if
tomorrow
never
comes
and
the
dance

both
are
superb
ballads
that
have
remained
two
of
his
most
beloved
songs
(both
of
highlights
of
his
1998
double
live
cd)
however
my
favorite
song
on
the
cd
(and
perhaps
the
best
song
he's
ever
done)
is
much
too
young
it's
a
terrific
story
about
the
rough
and
tumble
life
of
a
rodeo
cowboy
and
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
george
strait's
hit
amarillo
by
morning
other
great
uptempo
songs
on
this
album
include
not
counting
you
i've
got
a
good
thing
going
and
the
humorous
nobody
gets
off
in
this
town
all
of
the
elements
that
would
make
garth
a
star
are
on
this
cd
plus
it's
his
most
purely
country
cd
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
garth
country
music
and
wellwritten
songs

garth
cd
with
the
dance
it's
hard
to
find
his
song
the
dance
on
his
cd's
this
one
is
obviously
earlier
in
his
career
however
the
entire
cd
seems
to
be
devoted
to
his
songs
about
love
