sometimes
the
sound&nbsp
of
a

&nbsp
don’t

without

sometimes
the

whispering
words

when

they

bring

hope
you
remember
every
fight
&nbsp
i
know
i
could
be
noxious
or
occasionally
cruel
but
only
to
the
ones
i
loved
&nbsp
goodbye
lovers
and
friends…
&nbsp
don’t
get
inventory
don’t
fake
your
memory
don’t
give
me
virtues
that
i
never
had
don’t
get
sychophantal
we
never
were
sentimental
i
know
i
took
more
than
i
ever
gave
&nbsp
i
don’t
need
to
be
forgiven
but
a
moment
from
the
living
that’s
the
only
thing
i
ask
&nbsp
goodbye
lovers
and
friends…
…you
can
laugh
as
if
we’re
still
together
but
this
really
is
the
end
