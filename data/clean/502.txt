in
late
may
2004
gretchen
wilson's
debut
single
redneck
woman
became
the
first
by
a
solo
female
singer
to
top
the
billboard
country
singles
chart
in
over
two
years
it
also
reached
number
one
faster
than
any
single
in
the
previous
decade
at
the
same
time
her
debut
album
here
for
the
party
entered
the
country
album
chart
at
number
one
and
the
pop
album
chart
at
number
two
with
sales
of
227000
copies
the
biggest
opening
week
for
a
new
country
artist
on
record
given
the
overtly
country
style
of
her
music
at
a
time
when
much
country
had
been
leaning
toward
pop
wilson
was
immediately
hailed
as
the
latest
in
a
long
line
of
country
artists
leading
the
music
back
to
its
roots
her
own
roots
went
back
to
the
tiny
town
of
pocahontas
illinois
(36
miles
east
of
st
louis
missouri)
where
she
began
singing
as
a
child
her
mother
was
16
when
she
was
born
on
june
26
1973
her
father
left
when
she
was
two
she
grew
up
poor
living
in
a
succession
of
trailer
parks
she
went
to
school
only
through
the
eighth
grade
and
at
14
was
working
as
a
cook
and
bartender
in
the
same
club
where
her
mother
worked
by
the
age
of
20
she
was
singing
in
two
different
bands
in
the
area
she
moved
to
nashville
in
1996
and
tended
bar
while
singing
on
demos
and
in
clubs
for
the
next
seven
years
during
this
period
she
became
part
of
an
informal
group
of
singers
and
songwriters
known
as
the
muzik
mafia
who
met
once
a
week
to
try
out
new
material
she
and
john
rich
another
member
of
the
group
(and
a
former
member
of
lonestar)
wrote
redneck
woman
an
autobiographical
song
in
which
she
unabashedly
celebrated
her
redneck
whitetrash
background
in
2003
she
auditioned
for
and
was
signed
by
epic
records
redneck
woman
was
released
as
a
single
in
the
late
winter
of
2004
and
immediately
began
its
march
up
the
charts
here
for
the
party
originally
scheduled
for
release
in
july
was
moved
up
to
may
11
because
of
the
quick
success
of
the
single
as
it
too
became
a
hit
wilson
agreed
to
opening
spots
on
tours
with
brooks

dunn
and
montgomery
gentry
in
the
summer
of
2004
by
this
time
redneck
woman
had
become
a
classic
country
anthem
and
wilson
was
a
superstar
she
coped
with
the
instant
celebrity
and
continued
to
work
as
a
musician
finding
time
to
write
a
book
also
called
redneck
woman
which
hit
shops
in
2005
the
same
year
her
followup
album
all
jacked
up
appeared
one
of
the
boys
a
deeply
personal
album
and
the
first
album
in
which
wilson
had
a
hand
in
writing
most
of
the
songs
was
released
in
2007
her
parting
album
for
sony
was
a
bestof
in
2009
she
followed
it
with
her
first
independently
released
single
on
her
own
redneck
records
imprint
work
hard
play
harder
in
late
2009
followed
by
the
album
i've
got
your
country
right
here
in
2010
she
released
the
impressive
and
diverse
right
on
time
on
redneck
records
in
2013
along
with
an
album
of
covers
of
'70s
rock
songs
under
the
covers
and
the
holiday
album
christmas
in
my
heart
