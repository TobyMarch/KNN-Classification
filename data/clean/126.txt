kerplunk's
underground
success
led
to
a
number
of
major
record
labels
being
interested
in
signing
green

and
the
band
eventually
left
lookout!
and
signed
to
reprise
records
after
attracting
the
attention
of
producer
rob
cavallo
the
group
was
impressed
by
his
work
with
fellow
californian
band
the
muffs
and
later
remarked
that
cavallo
was
the
only
person
we
could
really
talk
to
and
connect
with[17]
reflecting
on
the
period
armstrong
told
spin
magazine
in
1999
i
couldn't
go
back
to
the
punk
scene
whether
we
were
the
biggest
success
in

or
the
biggest
failure

the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
get

100

were

the

also
joined
the

the

woodstock

where
they
started
an
infamous

the

further
aided

publicity
and
recognition[17]
and
helped
push
its
album
to
eventual
diamond
status
in
1995
dookie
won
the
grammy
award
for
best

the
single
debuted
at

on

the
song
was
followed
by
the
band's
fourth
studio
album
insomniac
which
was
released
in
the
fall
of
1995
insomniac
was
a
much
darker
and
heavier
response
to
the
band's
newfound
popularity
compared
to
the
more
melodic
dookie[17]
the
album
opened
to
a
warm
critical
reception
earning
4
out
of
5
stars
from
rolling
stone
which
said
in

the
good
stuff
actually
unfolds
and
gains
meaning
as
you
listen
without
sacrificing
any
of
its
electric
haywire
immediacy
and
green

are
as
good
as
this
stuff
gets[22]

green
day
began
to
work
on
a
new
album
in
1997
from
the
outset
both
the
band
and
cavallo
agreed
that
the
album
had
to
be
different
from
its
previous
albums[25]
the
result
was
nimrod
an
experimental
deviation
from
the
band's
standard
poppunk

music
the
new
album
was
released
in

1997
it
provided
a

45/5

may
not
be
an
innovative
record
per
se

it's
tremendously
satisfying[27]
rolling

more
critical
giving
it
3/5
and
saying

invites
the
question
who

to
listen
to
songs

social
commentary
from

the
conclusion

the

it

the
musical
have
been
positive
to
mixed
charles
isherwood
of
the
new
york
times
wrote
an
enthusiastic
review
for
the
broadway
production
he
called
the
show
a
pulsating
portrait
of
wasted
youth
that
invokes
all
the
standard
genre
conventions

only
to
transcend
them
through
the
power
of
its
music
and
the
artistry
of
its
execution
the
show
is
as
invigorating
and
ultimately
as
moving
as
anything
i’ve
seen
on
broadway
this
season
or
maybe
for
a
few
seasons
past
jed
gottlieb
of
the
boston
herald
enjoyed
the
premise
of
the
show
but
found
that
the
music
and
message
suffer
in
a
setting
where
the
audience
is
politely
soberly
seated[77]
michael
kuchiwara
of
the
associated
press
found
the
show
to
be
visually
striking
[and]
musically
adventurous
but
noted
that
the
show
has
the
barest
wisp
of
a
story
and
minimal
character
development
paul
kolnik
in
usa
today
enjoyed
the
contradiction
that
green
day's
massively
popular
starkly
disenchanted
album

would
be
the
feelgood
musical
of
the
season
time
magazine's
richard
zoglin
opined
that
the
score
is
as
pure
a
specimen
of
contemporary
punk
rock
as
broadway
has
yet
encountered
[yet]
there's
enough
variety

where
the
show
fall
short
is
as
a
fully
developed
narrative
he
concluded
that
american
idiot
despite
its
earnest
huffing
and
puffing
remains
little
more
than
an
annotated
rock
concert

still
[it]
deserves
at
least
two
cheers
–
for
its
irresistible
musical
energy
and
for
opening
fresh
vistas
for
that
odd
couple
rock
and
broadway[78]
peter
travers
from
rolling
stone
in
his
review
of
american
idiot
wrote
though
american
idiot
carries
echoes
of
such
rock
musicals
as
tommy
hair
rent
and
spring
awakening
it
cuts
its

path
to

controversy
[edit]
the
band
has
generated
controversy
over
whether
the
band's
musical
style
and
majorlabel
status
constitutes
as
true
punk[87]
in
reaction
to
both
the
style
of
music
and
the
background
of
the
band
john
lydon
former
front
man
of
the
1970s
punk
band
the
sex
pistols
commented
so
there
we
are
fending
off
all
that
and
it
pisses
me
off
that
years
later
a
wank
outfit
like
green
day
hop
in
and
nick
all
that
and
attach
it
to
themselves
they
didn't
earn
their
wings
to
do
that
and
if
they
were
true
punk
they
wouldn't
look
anything
like
they
do[88]
armstrong
himself
has
discussed
the
group's
status
of
being
a
punk
band
on
a
major
record
label
saying
sometimes
i
think
we've
become
totally
redundant
because
we're
this
big
band
now
we've
made
a
lot
of
money
–
we're
not
punk
rock
any
more
but
then
i
think
about
it
and
just
say
'you
can
take
us
out
of
a
punk
rock
environment
but
you
can't
take
the
punk
rock
out
of
us'[87]

angered
armstrong
began
ranting
while
a
screen
in
the
rear
of
the
audience
was
labeled
1
minutes
left
saying
you're
not
gonna
give
me
one
fucking
minute?
you've
gotta
be
fucking
kidding
me!
he
also
told
the
crowd
he
was
not
justin
bieber
and
labeled
the
festival
as
a
joke
when
the
screen
went
blank
armstrong
smashed
his
guitar
while
bassist
mike
dirnt
smashed
his
bass
armstrong
then
gave
the
finger
and
declared
that
green
day
would
be
back
before
throwing
his
microphone
down
and
walking
off
the
stage[89]
two
days
later
the
band's
representative
apologized
for
the
incident
on
their
behalf
stating
that
green
day
would
like
everyone
to
know
that
their
set
was
not
cut
short
by
clear
channel
and
to
apologize
to
those
they
offended
at
the
iheartradio
festival
in
las
vegas
also
adding
that
armstrong
will
be
headed
to
rehab
for
abuse
of
alcohol
and
prescription
pills
for
anxiety
and
insomnia[90]
however
mike
dirnt
would
later
say
in
an
interview
with
rolling
stone
that
he
agreed
with
what
billie
joe
meant
by
his
rant[91]
