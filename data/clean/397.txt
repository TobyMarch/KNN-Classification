radio
stations
after

various
incarnations
of
the

have
emerged
over
the
years
culminating
in
a
more
stable
lineup
based
around
guitarists
scott
gorham
and
john
sykes
sykes
left
the
band
in
june
2009
thin
lizzy’s
leader
lynott
was
composer
or
cocomposer
of
almost
all
their
songs
he
was
also
one
of
the
few
black
men
to
achieve
significant
success
in
hard
rock
as
well
as
being
multiracial
the
band
drew
its
members
not
only
from
both
sides
of
the
irish
border
but
also
from
both
the
catholic
and
protestant
communities
their
music
reflects
a
wide
range
of
influences
including
country
music
psychedelic
rock
irish
music
and
traditional
irish
folk
music
but
is
generally
classified
as
hard
rock
or
heavy
metal
critic
for
allmusic
john
dougan
wrote
“as
the
band’s
creative
force
lynott
was
a
more
insightful
and
intelligent
writer
than
many
of
his
ilk
preferring
sliceoflife
workingclass
dramas
of
love
and
hate
influenced
by
bob
dylan
van
morrison
bruce
springsteen
and
virtually
all
of
the
irish
literary
tradition”
van
morrison
jeff
beck
and
jimi
hendrix
were
major
influences
during
the
early
days
of
the
band
and
later
influences
included
american
artists
little
feat
and
