powell
performed
as
a
solo
artist
performing
under
the

enrolled
in
the
jazz
program
at
concordia
university
where
she
met

land
of
talk[1]
eric
thibodeau
replaced
wheaton
on
drums
in
may
2007
to
complete
a
new
lineup[2]
some
bands
have
a
bit
more
of
a
meteoric
rise
and
some
are
slow
burners
i
like
to
think
we're
a
slow
burner
powell
says
it's
totally
true
to
who
i
am
and
how
i
approach
my
own
life
very
slow
and
very
unsure
but
curious
and
it
all
works
out[3]
land

has
received
funding
from
agencies
such
as
the

released
its
first
ep
applause
cheer
boo
hiss
on
april
4
2006
on
dependent
music
the
single
summer
special
deals
with
the
damaging
nature
of
intrafemale
conflict
and
the
sadness
of
losing
oneself
by
way
of
buying
into
the
damaging
stereotypes
of
femininity
powell
commented
in
an
interview
about
what
inspired
her
to
write
summer
special
and
how
it
compared
to
her
life
growing
up
as
a
tomboy
another
standout
track
from
the
ep
is
speak
to
me
bones
which
also
deals
with
the
theme
of
relational
conflict
this
track
exemplifies
their
use
of
soft
vocals
and
gritty
rock
sounding
musical
arrangements
the
music
video
for
speak
to
me
bones
was
directed
by
a
former
concordia
school
mate
jeff
st
jules
the
concept
of
the
video
was
kept
simple
shot
in
black
and
white

true
to
the
band's
nofrills
