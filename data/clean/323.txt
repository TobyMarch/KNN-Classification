prolonged

in
all
three
fields

and
that's

he's

difficult

made
a
mid

dobie

if
ever
the
adjective
enigmatic
applied
to
a
singer
that
has
to
be
dobie
gray
even
details
of
his
birth
are
murky
born
on
july
26
in
either
1940
or
1942
as
either
lawrence
darrow
brown
or
leonard
victor
ainsworth
in
either
simonton
or
brookshire
texas
take
your
pick
one
thing
is
clear
however
and
that
is
that
he
grew
up
on
gospel
and
country
music
and
recorded
country
soul
rb
and
pop
with
equal
aplomb
and
varying
degrees
of
success
under
several
stage
names
these
included
leonard
victor
ainsworth
larry
curtis
and
larry
dennis
before
settling
on
dobie
gray
while
with
the
small
cordak
label
in
1963
there
he
cut
the
bouncy
rb
tune

which
reached
#
91
billboard
pop
hot
100
that
january
[track
3]
b/w
walkin'
and
whistlin'
[not
included]
but
made
no
impression
at
all
on
the
rb
charts
a
result
no
doubt
of
cordak's
lack
of
promotional
capability
two
full
years
and
a
change
of
labels
[the
marginally
larger
charger]
later
he
struck
gold
when
the
in

hot
100
in
may
1965
b/w
walk
with
love
[not
here]
and
again
missed
the
rb
charts
all
three
of
his
hits
to
this
point
had
been
produced
by
fred
darian
whose
main
claim
to
fame
[other
than
two
minor
hits
of
his
own
in
1961]
had
been
as
cowriter
of
the
larry
verne
1960
novelty
hit
mr
custer
following
a
long
8year
absence
from
the
charts
during
which
time
he
recorded
albums
for
the
prophecy
label
as
part
of
the
group

and
also
appeared
in
the
la

of

dobie
returned
with
a
bang
in
early
1973
with
a
major
label
drift
away

one
of
the
best
rock
ballads
ever
and
produced
by
paul
williams'
brother
mentor

made
it
to
#
5
hot
100/#

adult
contemporary
[ac]
but
which
for
some
reason
again
failed
to
click
with
the
rb
audience
reaching
only
a
lowly
#
42
on
the
decca
label
(which
certainly
had
promotional
capabilities)
the
flip
was
city

which
is
yet
another
left
out
of
this
compilation
again
however
the
followup
and

loving

[also

did
not
do
well
at
least
not
on
the
hot

[#
61]
and
rb
[#
81]
charts
although
it
did
reach
a
quite
respectable
#

in
september
1973
for
the
new
mca
title
of
decca
[it's
flipside
now
that

loving

turned
up

resurfaced

again
with

only
this
time

he
never

huge
success
there

of
