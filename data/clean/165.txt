lost
kitten
(official
video)
from
metric
on
vimeo
today
marks
the
muchanticipated
premiere
of
our
new
video
for
the
song
lost
kitten
in
which
director
sammy
rawal
leads
us
on
an
unusual
search
for
home
shot
over
two
days
in
mexico
city
the
clip
features
acclaimed
ballroom
dancer/actor
sheldon
mcintosh
(otherwise
known
as
tynomi
banks
the
name
he
goes
by
when
performing
in
drag)
and
showcases
rawal’s
hyperstylized
use
of
bold
color
and
unique
choreography
in
rawal’s
reimagining
of
the
archetypal
heroic
journey
sheldon
embarks
on
a
mysterious
pilgrimage
through
mexico
city
and
into
the
canal
maze
of
xochimilco
on
a
flatbottomed
trajinera
in
search
of
his
house
mother
an
“angel”
in
his
memories
upon
reaching
his
destination
sheldon
delivers
an
epic
vogueing
performance
(!)
to
celebrate
his
spiritual
reunion
with
the
maternal
his
massive
onscreen
presence
is
only
amplified
by
his
bold
attire
sequined
jacket
and
kitten
heels
the
shoot
itself
proved
as
colorful
as
the
concept
airport
troubles
delayed
sheldon’s
arrival
to
within
hours
of
when
filming
was
scheduled
to
begin
a
striking
figure
at
6
foot
2
sheldon’s
choice
of
travel
wear
was
a
pair
of
high
heeled
boots
which
had
him
towering
above
the
local
community
as
he
attempted
to
navigate
the
busy
pedestrian
streets
“as
he
walked
through
the
city
sheldon
was
literally
parting
the
huge
crowd
that
had
gathered
everybody
was
staring
at
him
in
amazement”
recalls
rawal
“he
was
a
bit
apprehensive
at
first
about
how
the
local
community
would
react
to
him
but
that
feeling
quickly
disappeared
as
people
started
cheering
and
shouting
‘el
guapo!’
(the
handsome
one)
smiling
and
waving
from
their
passing
cars”
watch
lost
kitten
and
let
the
beautiful
quest
begin

metriclovesyou
ps
hope
you’ve
been
having
fun
with
the
metric
synthetica
app
it’s
a
bit
addictive
i’ve
spent
many
hours
traveling
between
cities
these
past
few
weeks
and
have
gotten
into
creating
totally
abstract
sounds
with
my
remixes
my
favorite
move
is
extreme
delay
feedback
combined
with
pitch
shift
on
“speed
the
collapse”
the
original
song
becomes
unrecognizable
and
the
landscape
images
become
like
hallucinations
very
useful
when
waiting
in
very
long
lines
if
you
don’t
