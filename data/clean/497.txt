george
strait
out
of
all
the
new
country
singers
to
emerge
in
the
early
'80s
george
strait
stayed
the
closest
to
traditional
country
drawing
from
both
the
honky
tonk
and
western
swing
traditions
strait
didn't
refashion
the
genres
instead
he
revitalized
them
for
a
new
decade
in
the
process
he
became
one
of
the
most
popular
and
influential
singers
of
the
decade
sparking
a
wave
of
neotraditionalist
singers
from
randy
travis
and
dwight
yoakam
to
clint
black
garth
brooks
and
alan
jackson
strait
was
born
and
raised
in
texas
the
son
of
a
junior
high
school
teacher
who
also
owned
and
operated
a
ranch
that
had
been
in
the
strait
family
for
nearly
100
years
when
george
was
a
child
his
mother
left
the
family
taking
her
daughter
but
leaving
her
sons
behind
with
their
father
during
his
childhood
he
would
spend
his
weekdays
in
town
and
his
weekends
on
the
ranch
strait
began
playing
music
as
a
teenager
joining
a
rock

roll
garage
band
after
his
high
school
graduation
in
the
late
'60s
he
enrolled
in
college
but
soon
dropped
out
and
eloped
with
his
high
school
sweetheart
norma
in
1971
strait
enlisted
in
the
army
two
years
later
he
was
stationed
in
hawaii
while
there
he
began
playing
country
music
initially
with
an
armysponsored
country
band
called
rambling
country
they
played
several
dates
off
the
base
under
the
name
santee
strait
left
the
army
in
1975
returning
to
texas
with
the
intent
of
completing
his
education
he
enrolled
in
southwest
texas
state
university
at
san
marcos
where
he
studied
agriculture
while
he
was
studying
he
formed
his
own
country
band
ace
in
the
hole
ace
in
the
hole
made
a
few
records
for
the
independent
dallasbased
label
d
in
the
late
'70s
but
they
never
went
anywhere
toward
the
end
of
the
decade
strait
attempted
to
carve
out
a
niche
in
nashville
but
he
failed
since
he
lacked
any
strong
connections
in
1979
he
became
friends
with
erv
woolsey
a
texas
club
owner
who
had
formerly
worked
for
mca
records
woolsey
had
several
mca
executives
come
down
to
texas
to
hear
strait
his
performance
convinced
the
company
to
sign
him
in
1980
unwound
strait's
first
single
was
released
in
the
spring
of
1981
and
climbed
into
the
top
ten
the
followup
down
and
out
stalled
at
16
but
if
you're
thinking
you
want
a
stranger
(there's
one
coming
home)
reached
number
three
in
early
1982
the
song
sparked
a
remarkable
string
of
top
ten
hits
that
ran
well
into
the
'90s
during
that
time
he
had
an
astonishing
31
number
one
singles
beginning
with
1982's
fool
hearted
memory
throughout
the
'80s
he
dominated
the
country
singles
charts
and
his
albums
consistently
went
platinum
or
gold
strait
rarely
abandoned
hardcore
honky
tonk
and
western
swing

toward
the
beginning
of
the
'90s
his
sound
became
a
little
slicker
but
it
was
only
a
relative
change
strait
was
also
one
of
the
few
'80s
superstars
to
survive
the
generational
shift
of
the
early
'90s
that
began
with
the
phenomenal
success
of
garth
brooks
in
1992
he
made
his
first
movie
pure
country
which
featured
him
in
the
lead
role
strait
released
a
fourdisc
box
set
career
retrospective
strait
out
of
the
box
in
1995
by
the
spring
of
1996
it
had
become
one
of
the
five
biggestselling
box
sets
in
popular
music
history
blue

his
1996
album
debuted
on
the
country
charts
at
number
one
and
the
pop
charts
at
number
seven
in
1997
he
released

your
love

me

it
with
one
step
at
a
time
in
1998
always
never
the

a
year
later
as
did

you
are
the
simply
titled
george
strait
featuring
the
hit
single
go
on
hit
the
shelves
in
late
2000
did
strait
slow
down?
nah
the
following
year
saw
the
release
of
the
road
less
traveled
which
qualified
as
an
experimental
album
of
sorts
for
the
veteran
performer
while
it
didn't
stray
very
far
from
his
new
traditionalist
country
sound
road
did
include
a
foray
into
vocal
processing
that
was
about
as
country
as
a
pair
of
stilettohealed
cowboy
boots
but
the
experimentation
was
welcome
for
it
revealed
that
strait
was
still
hungry
even
after
millions
upon
millions
of
records
sold
strait
issued
two
projects
in
2003
for
the
last
time
live
from
the
astrodome
chronicled
his
headlining
set
at
the
last
houston
livestock
and
rodeo
ever
held
in
the
big
texas
dome
while
honkytonkville
was
a
fiery
set
of
hard
country
lauded
by
critics
for
its
mixture
of
the
old
strait
with
his
modern
superstar
self
somewhere
down
in
texas
arrived
in
2005
followed
by
it
just

2006

was
coproduced
by

and
recorded
at
jimmy

both
missed
the
top
of
the
charts
peaking

respectively

and
about
a
year
after
its

strait
announced
that

he
planned
one
last
tour
called
the

i
if
keith
whitley
wouldn't
have
died
than
he
would
of
actually
been
having
his
name
carried
to
the
crowns
of
country
music
instead
of
george
strait
and
yes
george
is
still
the
best
for
this
generation
but
country
would
of
been
far
more
different
than
ever
i
wish
keith
were
still
alive
now
