fat
joe
(born
joseph
cartagena
on
august
19
1970)
is
a
american
rapper
of
puerto
rican
and
cuban
heritage
born
and
brought
up
in
the
bronx
joe
was
popular
in
the
large
underground
hip
hop
scene
during
the
early
and
mid1990s
during
this
period
joe
was
affiliated
with
krsone
—
there
are
pictures
online
at
krsone’s
temple
of
hiphop
site
showing
the
pair
drawing
graffiti
(“bombing”)
together
he
is
also
the
most
widely
known
member
of
the
ditc
crew
(the
“digging
in
the
crates
crew”)
along
with
smaller
hiphoppers
such
as
diamond
d
lord
finesse
o
c
ag
buckwild
occasional
member
big
l
(deceased)
and
big
pun
(deceased)
the
title
of
the
group
refers
to
djs
who
“dig
in
the
crates”
of
used
record
stores
to
find
rare
or
novel
records
with
“breaks”
that
they
could
use
as
fat
beats
for
production
or
in
performances
fat
joe
has
flirted
with
gaining
mass
recognition
in
the
mainstream
american
music
scene
most
prominently
in
his
massive
cameos
on
songs
by
artists
such
as
jennifer
lopez
fat
joe’s
first
single
off
his
eleventh
album
is
“another
round”
a
collaboration
with
chris
brown
the
another
round
songfacts
reports
that
it
was
his
first
hot
100
hit
for
four
years
fat
joe
has
also
had
major
beef
with
his
ex
ts
crew
member
cuban
linkz
who
was
a
part
of
fat
joe
ts
crew
until
they
had
a
disagreement
about
money
royalties
and
the
pair
had
a
fight
and
fat
joe
knifed
cuban
linkz
on
the
side
of
his
face
the
beef
has
quiet
down
now
but
they
are
no
longer
friends
and
nor
do
they
speak
to
each
other

it's
hardly
the
be
all
and
end
all
but
how
can
you
say
that
if
someone
in
their
respective
field
has
been
around
for
a
while
it
doesn't
mean
shit?
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
his
career
and
what
he's
done
to
achieve
it

he's
not
scraping
by
or
putting
out
albums
for
peanuts
yes
this
doesn't
automatically
mean
he's
dope
but
it's
a
noteworthy
facet
joe's
been
part
of
several
different
eras
in
hiphop
and
hasn't
dropped
off
the
radar
like
so
many
others
ag
(a
more
talented
rapper
(from
joe's
old
camp
as
i'm
sure
you
know))
has
been
around
for
just
as
long
but
everything's
berri
was
fucking
dreadful
joe's
last
effort
was
impressive
people
put
too
much
stock
in
skill
when
rating
certain
rappers
comparative
lack
of
ability
to
others
is
hm
obvious
whether
or
not
it's
obvious
is
fucking
irrelevant
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
a
weak
excuse
to
pan
his
music
you're
regurgitating
what
i
posted
without
really
engaging
with
it
and
holding
joe
to
an
invisible
standard

theabbott
as
usually
i'm
not
aware
of
disputes
and
rap
affairs
the
comparative
lack
of
ability
to
others
is
hm
obvious
listen
to
the
posse
cut
12
pass
it
for
example
and
name
the
mc
or
the
verse
that
is
worse
than
him/his
the
lack
of
longevity
might
indicate
a
here
today
gone
tomorrow
story
however
the
presence
of
longevity
doesn't
mean
shit
some
people
clearly
don't
see
the
longevity
you're
describing
in
his
discography
i
don't
either

underrated
might
have
been
a
better
choice
in
hindsight
but
i’m
not
appending
the
word
“underappreciated”
to
the
barometer
of
success
(i’m
aware
that
fat
joe
has
done
quite
well
in
terms
of
sales
and
exposure)
i’m
appending
it
to
quality
i’m
not
saying
that
dude
has
been
putting
out
dope
album
after
dope
album
but
his
releases
have
generally
been
solid
at
the
very
least
a
lot
of
people
write
joe’s
music
off
on
the
basis
of
a
few
petty
disputes
ghostwriting
accusations
and
a
comparative
lack
of
ability
to
others
someone
can
be
successful
(or
at
least
established)
in
one
department
(be
it
commercial
or
underground)
and
still
not
get
fair
dues
(acclaim
etc)
longevity
(to
avoid
any
more
confusion
sustained
success
+
output
of
a
decent
level
as
opposed
to
the
mere
continuation
of
releasing
music)
goes
some
way
to
indicate
that
joe
has
credibility
as
a
rapper
–
credibility
that
i
feel
isn’t
always
acknowledged

only
you're

so
special
most
of
his
'00s
albums
are
decent
it
shouldn't
matter
that
much
(unfortunately
it
does
for
a
lot
of
clowns)
if
he's
making
commercial
songs
he's
certainly
not
in
the
minority
there
fat
joe
is
obviously
not
the
most
skilled
or
creative
rapper
you'll
encounter
but
his

is
underappreciated
20
years

represent

still
putting
