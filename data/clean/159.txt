weweremonkeys
land
of
talk
“it’s
okay”
by
matt
lambert
weweremonkeys
making
of
“it’s
okay”
to
start
we
were
approached
by
cherie
sinclair
at
the
field
to
write
a
treatment
for
land
of
talk’s
“it’s
okay”
we
started
by
listening
to
the
song
over
and
over
on
repeat
when
we
make
music
videos
our
goal
is
to
create
a
visual
work
that
glues
seamlessly
to
the
music
we
strive
to
create
a
unified
work
of
art
this
doesn’t
usually
mean
literally
translating
the
lyrics
into
visuals
but
more
like
using
the
mood
or
overall
feel
that
we
get
from
the
music
as
our
inspiration
the
idea
of
the
antiope
came
from
our
amazing
producer
marcella
moser
together
the
three
of
us
built
a
story
of
the
last
amazon
queen
riding
her
horse
to
her
doom
we
saw
her
riding
through
abstract
lonely
landscapes
and
finally
launching
from
a
cliff
to
disintegrate
into
nothingness
we
really
love
to
work
to
a
plan
but
we
also
love
to
change
our
plan
while
we’re
working
if
a
“hey
wouldn’t
it
be
cool
if…”
moment
happens
while
we’re
plugging
in
ae
we
jump
on
it
we
saw
the
piece
in
superslow
motion
with
dramatic
lighting
and
little
or
no
colour
to
us
this
idea
melted
perfectly
with
the
sad
slow
feeling
of
inevitable
doom
that
we
got
from
the
music
so
since
we
were
using
live
action
we
needed
a
costume
for
our
amazon
the
three
of
us
tracked
down
a
lot
of
interesting
gear
from
an
old
red
leather
jacket
to
a
traditional
silk
chinese
dressing
gown
to
a
skirt
of
weasel
pelts
that
my
mom
supplied
us
with
we
spent
two
days
staining
scraping
and
handstitching
the
thing
together
in
our
dining
room
our
next
step
was
to
shoot
the
live
action
in
order
to
have
full
control
of
the
shoot
we
tracked
down
a
red
and
rented
it
for
a
week
we
figured
this
would
give
us
a
lot
of
freedom
and
bonus
we’d
learn
how
to
use
a
red!
to
help
us
shoot
we
contracted
the
services
of
our
good
friend
dominic
schaefer
to
be
our
main
dp
this
was
the
first
time
any
of
us
had
used
a
red
before
but
after
a
great
tutorial
from
red
rentals
vancouver
we
were
totally
set
we
drove
from
vancouver
to
lumby
bc
the
home
of
our
extremely
talented
(and
timegenerous)
actors
ines
stone
and
desi
the
horse
we
shot
on
the
grass
runway
of
raven
aviation
the
location
was
perfect
as
we
were
able
to
drive
along
side
the
horse
as
it
ran
shooting
from
the
open
door
of
a
minivan
thankfully
randy
rauck
the
owner
of
the
airstrip
was
really
a
cool
dude
—
and
he
took
davide
up
in
an
ultralight
to
shoot
aerials
of
the
actors
we
shot
everything
100fps
2k
169
using
nikon
lenses
we
shot
using
natural
light
mostly
early
morning
(4am
wake
up
calls)
thankfully
we
had
clear
skies
so
there
was
plenty
of
light
and
we
could
really
minimize
motion
blur
this
really
helped
us
out
when
twixtoring
the
footage
to
200fps
so
next
after
we
edited
our
footage
we
jumped
into
a
month
of
post
most
of
our
previous
work
is
pretty
twodimensional
collagebased
and
purely
animation
but
for
this
project
we
wanted
to
push
ourselves
so
we
decided
we’d
learn
how
to
build
depth
matte
paint
and
make
a
solid
composite
using
live
action
we
also
wanted
to
learn
how
to
roto
a
horse
and
rider
attach
3d
hair
onto
an
actor
and
stabilize
and
track
a
seriously
unstable
shot
from
an
ultralight
fun!
ae
and
ps
did
us
well
for
all
the
roto
/
keying
/
matte
painting
light
wrap
and
using
black
and
white
made
our
composites
straight
forward
we
used
c4d
to
make
the
hair
and
pftrack
to
attach
it
to
the
actor’s
hair
(tracking
tape

beads
on
the
wig
helped
us
out
here)
syntheyes
excellently
handled
the
3d
stabilization
and
tracking
of
our
wonky
aerial
shot
from
the
extremely
helpful
syntheyes
site
we
learned
we
needed
to
stabilize
in
3d
not
2d
and
after
a
solid
track
we
were
able
to
zoom
the
camera
out
in
3d
space
and
resolve
cool!
we
really
love
to
work
to
a
plan
but
we
also
love
to
change
our
plan
while
we’re
working
if
a
“hey
wouldn’t
it
be
cool
if…”
moment
happens
while
we’re
plugging
in
ae
we
jump
on
it
we
wanted
the
landscape
to
be
abstract
but
realized
that
instead
of
changing
the
visual
elements
it
was
more
interesting
to
change
the
physics
the
everlong
hair
floating
upwards
had
organically
found
its
way
into
our
initial
sketches
so
we
extrapolated
on
that
we
started
with
snow
and
dirt
floating
upwards
and
that
concept
evolved
to
the
tops
of
mountains
crumbling
and
being
sucked
skyward
this
abstraction
is
meant
to
dislocate
the
viewer
and
to
show
them
a
place
that
cannot
exist
by
the
rules
of
our
nature
we
created
our
own
laws
of
physics
our
initial
edit
had
the
video
with
about
twenty
scenes
but
half
way
through
post
we
realized
that
the
video
could
be
stronger
with
less
scenes
we
asked
ourselves
can
we
tell
this
story
in
four
scenes?
five?
six?
we
ended
up
with
ten
a
lot
of
great
footage
was
chopped
off
we
said
a
tearful
goodbye
to
fully
rotoscoped
actors
and
hand
painted
landscapes
our
storyboard
ended
up
being
10
sheets
of
8&times10
paper
taped
to
the
wall
each
with
a
still
of
the
scene
and
a
list
of
todos
our
process
to
was
this
watch
video
write
down
todos
do
to
dos
repeat
until
there
was
no
time
left
in
conclusion
i’d
like
to
say
that
it
was
a
helluva
fun
project
weweremonkeys
learned
many
new
skills
and
had
the
opportunity
to
work
with
a
lot
of
fantastic
people
i’d
also
like
to
say
that
all
of
the
post
(and
a
lot
of
the
other
stuff)
was
done
by
two
guys
on
two
computers
in
an
apartment
in
downtown
vancouver
and
here’s
something
fun
for
all
you
kids
out
there
—
see
if
you
can
find
davide
and
mihai
in
the
video
we’re
in
there
somewhere…
(here’s
a
hint
—
one
of
us
is
standing
one
of
us
is
crouching)

i
love
the
song
but
your
video
really
blew
me
away
and
inspired
me
to
write
a
more
literal
flow
of
the
video
in
verse
she
breaks
through
inspired
by
it’s
ok/land
of
talk
video
we
look
upon
her
mystical
face
as
a
journey
begins
to
take
place
from
a
far
away
land
to
a
place
near
at
hand
she
rides
in
a
land
of
mists
where
mountain
tops
ascend
crows
fly
from
her
hair
she
is
small
and
contraire
a
mask
covers
her
face
a
contrivance
of
her
race
to
speak
their
truths
in
riddles
to
show
the
way
with
symbols
wolves
race
through
the
forest
ethereal
fires
burn
in
their
chests
they
pursue
in
haste
but
cannot
match
her
pace
crows
fly
from
her
flowing
hair
to
lend
their
perspective
looking
down
they
see
the
path
more
clearly
in
flocks
they
proceed
seeing
forests
as
trees
they
see
the
way
through
to
a
land
of
many
moons
she
races
ahead
raising
the
bones
of
the
dead
and
leaps
with
her
steed
upheld
and
transformed
by
her
deed
