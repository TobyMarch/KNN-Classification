naotas_forehead
i'll
reiterate
what
i
said
a
while
ago
that
the
album
could
be
recorded
in
a
weekend
just
throw
the
band
in
a
shack
with
calvin
johnson
alcohol
and
recording
equipment
boom
it's
done
and
the
result
would
assuredly
be
better
than
their
last
two
albums
(which
were
destroyed
by
overproduction
up
the
ass
using
drum
machines
over
jeremiah
on
wwd
it's
obscene)

i
agree
they
cancelled
their
europe
tour
to
supposedly
work
on
the
album
we
should
have
a
release
date
by
now
but
all
we're
getting
is
a
bunch
of
stupid

the

is
becoming
masochistic
how
can
they
have
managed
to
tour
and
stay
active
so
long
and
have
so
little
(that
we
know
of)
to
show
for
the
time?
i
love
modest
mouse
and
isaac
brock's
songwriting
and
i
just
want
them
to
release
the
damn

already
it's
