biography
by
most
accounts
george
jones
was
the
finest
vocalist
in
the
recorded
history
of
country
music
initially
he
was
a
hardcore
honky
tonker
in
the
tradition
of
hank
williams
but
over
the
course
of
his
career
he
developed
an
affecting
nuanced
ballad
style
in
the
course
of
his
career
he
never
left
the
top
of
the
country
charts
even
as
he
suffered
innumerable
personal
and
professional
difficulties
only
eddy
arnold
had
more
top
ten
hits
and
jones
always
stayed
closer
to
the
roots
of
hardcore
country
jones
was
born
and
raised
in
east
texas
near
the
city
of
beaumont
at
an
early
age
he
displayed
an
affection
for
music
he
enjoyed
the
gospel
he
heard
in
church
and
on
the
family's
carter
family
records
but
he
truly
became
fascinated
with
country
music
when
his
family
bought
a
radio
when
he
was
seven
when
he
was
nine
his
father
bought
him
his
first
guitar
soon
his
father
had
jones
playing
and
singing
on
the
streets
on
beaumont
earning
spare
change
at
16
he
ran
away
to
jasper
texas
where
he
sang
at
a
local
radio
station
jones
married
dorothy
his
first
wife
in
1950
when
he
was
19
years
old
the
marriage
collapsed
within
a
year
and
he
enlisted
in
the
marines
at
the
end
of
1951
though
the
us
was
at
war
with
korea
jones
never
served
overseas
â€”
he
was
stationed
at
a
military
camp
in
california
where
he
kept
singing
in
bars
after
he
was
discharged
jones
immediately
began
performing
again
in
1953
jones
was
discovered
by
record
producer
pappy
daily
who
was
also
the
coowner
of
starday
records
a
local
texas
label
impressed
with
jones'
potential
daily
signed
the
singer
to
starday
no
money
in
this
deal
jones'
first
single
was
released
in
early
1954
but
it
received
no
attention
starday
released
three
more
singles
that
year
which
all
were
ignored
jones
released
why
baby
why
late
in
the
summer
of
1955
and
the
single
became
his
first
hit
peaking
at
number
four
however
its
momentum
was
halted
by
a
cover
version
by
webb
pierce
and
red
sovine
that
hit
number
one
on
the
country
charts
jones
was
on
the
road
to
success
and
daily
secured
the
singer
a
spot
on
the
louisiana
hayride
where
he
was
cobilled
with
elvis
presley
jones
reached
the
top
ten
with
regularity
in
1956
with
such
singles
as
what
am
i
worth
and
just
one
more
that
same
year
jones
recorded
some
rockabilly
singles
under
the
name
thumper
jones
which
were
unsuccessful
both
commercially
and
artistically
in
august
he
joined
the
cast
of
the
grand
ole
opry
and
his
first
album
appeared
by
the
end
of
the
year
in
1957
starday
records
signed
a
distribution
deal
with
mercury
records
and
jones'
records
began
appearing
under
the
mercury
label
daily
began
recording
jones
in
nashville
and
his
first
single
for
the
new
label
don't
stop
the
music
was
another
top
ten
hit
throughout
1958
he
was
landing
near
the
top
of
the
charts
culminating
with
white
lightning
which
spent
five
weeks
at
number
one
in
the
spring
of
1959
his
next
big
hit
arrived
two
years
later
when
the
ballad
tender
years
spent
seven
weeks
at
number
one
tender
years
displayed
a
smoother
production
and
larger
arrangement
than
his
previous
hits
and
it
pointed
the
way
toward
jones'
later
success
as
a
balladeer
in
early
1962
jones
reached
number
five
with
achin'
breakin'
heart
which
would
turn
out
to
be
his
last
hit
for
mercury
records
daily
became
a
staff
producer
for
united
artists
records
in
1962
and
jones
followed
him
to
the
label
his
first
single
for
ua
she
thinks
i
still
care
was
his
third
number
one
hit
in
1963
jones
began
performing
and
recording
with
melba
montgomery
during
the
early
'60s
mainstream
country
music
was
getting
increasingly
slick
but
jones
and
montgomery's
harmonies
were
raw
and
laden
with
bluegrass
influences
their
first
duet
we
must
have
been
out
of
our
minds
(spring
1963)
was
their
biggest
hit
peaking
at
number
three
the
pair
continued
to
record
together
throughout
1963
and
1964
although
they
never
again
had
a
top
ten
hit
they
also
reunited
in
1966
and
1967
recording
a
couple
of
albums
and
singles
for
musicor
jones
had
a
number
of
solo
hits
in
1963
and
1964
as
well
peaking
with
the
number
three
the
race
is
on
in
the
fall
of
1964
under
the
direction
of
daily
jones
moved
to
the
new
record
label
musicor
in
1965
his
first
single
for
musicor
things
have
gone
to
pieces
was
a
top
ten
hit
in
the
spring
of
1965
between
1965
and
1970
he
had
17
top
ten
hits
for
musicor
while
at
musicor
jones
recorded
almost
300
songs
in
five
years
during
that
time
he
cut
a
number
of
firstrate
songs
including
country
classics
like
love
bug
walk
through
this
world
with
me
and
a
good
year
for
the
roses
he
also
recorded
a
fair
share
of
mediocre
material
and
given
the
sheer
amount
of
songs
he
sang
that
isn't
surprising
although
jones
made
a
couple
of
records
that
were
genuine
tributes
or
experiments
he
also
tried
to
fit
into
contemporary
country
styles
such
as
the
bakersfield
sound
not
all
of
the
attempts
resulted
in
hits
but
he
consistently
charted
the
top
ten
with
his
singles
if
not
with
his
albums
musicor
wound
up
flooding
the
market
with
george
jones
records
for
the
rest
of
the
'60s
jones'
albums
for
musicor
tended
to
be
arranged
thematically
and
only
two
his
1965
duet
george
jones

gene
pitney
and
1969's
i'll
share
my
world
with
you
charted
that
meant
that
while
jones
was
one
of
the
most
popular
and
acclaimed
singers
in
country
music
there
was
still
a
surplus
of
material
like
his
discography
jones'
personal
life
was
spinning
out
of
control
he
was
drinking
heavily
and
began
missing
concerts
his
second
wife
shirley
filed
for
divorce
in
1968
and
jones
moved
to
nashville
where
he
met
tammy
wynette
the
most
popular
new
female
singer
in
country
music
soon
jones
and
wynette
fell
in
love
they
married
on
february
16
1969
at
the
same
time
jones
married
wynette
tensions
that
had
been
building
between
jones
and
longtime
producer
daily
culminated
jones
was
unhappy
with
the
sound
of
his
musicor
records
and
he
placed
most
of
the
blame
on
daily
after
his
marriage
jones
wanted
to
record
with
wynette
but
musicor
wouldn't
allow
him
to
appear
on
her
label
epic
and
epic
wouldn't
let
her
sing
on
a
musicor
album
furthermore
epic
wanted
to
lure
jones
away
from
musicor
jones
was
more
than
willing
to
leave
but
he
had
to
fulfill
his
contract
before
the
company
would
let
him
go
while
he
continued
recording
material
for
musicor
epic
entered
contract
negotiations
with
their
rivals
and
halfway
through
1971
jones
severed
ties
with
musicor
and
daily
he
signed
away
all
the
rights
to
his
musicor
recordings
in
the
process
the
label
continued
to
release
jones
albums
for
a
couple
of
years
and
they
also
licensed
recordings
to
rca
who
released
two
singles
and
a
series
of
budgetpriced
albums
in
the
early
'70s
jones
signed
with
epic
records
in
october
of
1971
it
was
the
culmination
of
a
busy
year
for
jones
one
that
saw
him
and
wynette
becoming
the
biggest
stars
in
country
music
racking
up
a
number
of
top
ten
hits
as
solo
artists
and
selling
out
concerts
across
the
country
as
a
duo
jones
had
successfully
remade
his
image
from
a
shorthaired
crazed
honky
tonker
to
more
relaxed
sensitive
balladeer
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
cut
his
first
records
for
epic
jones'
new
record
producer
was
billy
sherrill
who
had
been
responsible
for
wynette's
hit
albums
sherrill
was
known
for
his
lush
stringladen
productions
and
his
precise
aggressive
approach
in
the
studio
under
his
direction
musicians
were
there
to
obey
his
orders
and
that
included
the
singers
as
well
jones
had
been
accustomed
to
the
relaxed
style
of
daily
who
was
the
polar
opposite
of
sherrill
as
a
result
the
singer
and
producer
were
tense
at
first
but
soon
the
pair
developed
a
fruitful
working
relationship
with
sherrill
jones
became
a
fullfledged
balladeer
sanding
away
the
rough
edges
of
his
hardcore
honky
tonk
roots
we
can
make
it
his
first
solo
single
for
epic
was
a
celebration
of
jones'
marriage
to
wynette
written
by
sherrill
and
glenn
sutton
the
song
was
a
number
two
hit
early
in
1972
kicking
off
a
successful
career
at
epic
the
ceremony
jones
and
wynette's
second
duet
followed
we
can
make
it
and
also
became
a
top
ten
hit
loving
you
could
never
be
better
followed
its
predecessors
into
the
top
ten
at
the
end
of
1972
by
now
the
couple's
marriage
was
becoming
a
public
soap
opera
with
their
audience
following
each
single
as
if
they
were
news
reports
even
though
they
were
proclaiming
their
love
through
their
music
the
couple
had
begun
to
fight
frequently
jones
was
sinking
deep
into
alcoholism
and
drug
abuse
which
escalated
as
the
couple
continued
to
tour
together
though
every
single
he
released
in
1973
went
into
the
top
ten
jones'
personal
life
was
getting
increasingly
difficult
wynette
filed
for
divorce
in
august
1973
shortly
after
she
filed
the
papers
the
couple
decided
to
reconcile
and
her
petition
was
withdrawn
following
her
withdrawal
the
duo
had
a
number
one
single
with
the
appropriately
titled
we're
gonna
hold
on
in
the
summer
of
1974
jones
had
his
first
number
one
hit
since
walk
through
this
world
with
me
with
the
grand
tour
a
song
that
drew
a
deft
portrait
of
a
broken
marriage
he
followed
it
with
another
number
one
hit
the
door
not
long
after
its
release
he
recorded
these
days
(i
barely
get
by)
which
featured
lyrics
cowritten
by
wynette
two
days
after
he
recorded
the
song
wynette
left
jones
they
divorced
within
a
year
the
late
'70s
were
plagued
with
trouble
for
jones
between
1975
and
the
beginning
of
1980
he
had
only
two
top
ten
solo
hits
â€”
these
days
(i
barely
get
by)
(1975)
and
her
name
is
(1976)
though
they
divorced
jones
and
wynette
continued
to
record
and
tour
together
and
that
is
where
he
racked
up
the
hits
beginning
with
the
backtoback
1976
number
ones
golden
ring
and
near
you
the
decrease
in
hits
accurately
reflects
the
downward
spiral
in
jones'
health
in
the
late
'70s
when
he
became
addicted
not
only
to
alcohol
but
to
cocaine
as
well
jones
became
notorious
for
his
drunken
intoxicated
rampages
often
involving
both
drugs
and
shotguns
jones
would
disappear
for
days
at
a
time
he
began
missing
a
substantial
amount
of
concerts
â€”
in
1979
alone
he
missed
54
shows
â€”
which
earned
him
the
nickname
noshow
jones
jones'
career
began
to
pick
up
in
1978
when
he
began
flirting
with
rock

roll
covering
chuck
berry's
maybellene
with
johnny
paycheck
and
recording
a
duet
with
james
taylor
called
bartender's
blues
the
success
of
the
singles
â€”
both
went
top
ten
â€”
led
to
an
album
of
duets
my
very
special
guests
in
1979
though
it
was
poised
to
be
a
return
to
the
top
of
the
charts
for
jones
he
neglected
to
appear
at
the
scheduled
recording
sessions
and
had
to
overdub
his
vocals
after
his
partners
recorded
theirs
that
same
year
doctors
told
the
singer
he
had
to
quit
drinking
otherwise
his
life
was
in
jeopardy
jones
checked
into
a
rehab
clinic
but
left
after
a
month
uncured
due
to
his
cocaine
addiction
his
weight
had
fallen
from
150
pounds
to
a
mere
100
despite
his
declining
health
jones
managed
a
comeback
in
1980
it
began
with
a
top
ten
duet
with
tammy
wynette
two
story
house
early
in
the
year
but
the
song
that
pushed
him
back
to
the
top
of
the
charts
was
the
dramatic
ballad
he
stopped
loving
her
today
the
single
hit
number
one
in
the
spring
of
the
year
beginning
a
new
series
of
top
ten
hits
and
number
one
singles
that
ran
through
1986
the
string
of
hits
was
so
successful
it
rivaled
the
peak
of
his
popularity
in
the
'60s
he
stopped
loving
her
today
was
followed
by
the
top
ten
i'm
not
ready
yet
and
an
album
i
am
what
i
am
in
the
fall
of
the
1980
i
am
what
i
am
became
his
most
successful
album
going
platinum
throughout
1981
and
1983
he
had
eight
top
ten
hits
although
he
was
having
hits
again
he
hadn't
kicked
his
addictions
jones
was
still
going
on
crazed
intoxicated
rampages
which
culminated
with
a
televised
police
chase
of
jones
who
was
driving
drunk
through
the
streets
of
nashville
following
his
arrest
jones
managed
to
shake
his
drug
and
alcohol
addictions
with
the
support
of
his
fourth
wife
nancy
sepulvada
jones
and
sepulvada
married
in
march
of
1983
soon
after
their
marriage
he
began
to
detoxicate
and
by
the
end
of
1983
he
had
completed
his
rehabilitation
jones
continued
to
have
top
ten
hits
regularly
until
1987
when
country
radio
became
dominated
by
newer
artists
ironically
the
artists
who
kept
him
off
the
charts
â€”
singers
like
randy
travis
keith
whitley
and
dwight
yoakam
â€”
were
heavily
influenced
by
jones
himself
jones
and
sepulvada
moved
back
to
nashville
in
1987
in
1988
he
recorded
his
final
album
with
billy
sherrill
one
woman
man
the
title
song
which
was
a
hit
for
johnny
horton
in
1956
was
jones'
final
solo
top
ten
hit
one
woman
man
was
his
last
record
for
epic
records
after
its
release
he
moved
to
mca
releasing
his
first
record
for
the
label
and
along
came
jones
in
the
fall
of
1991
in
between
its
release
and
one
woman
man
arrived
a
duet
with
randy
travis
a
few
ole
country
boys
that
was
a
top
ten
hit
in
the
fall
of
1990
jones'
records
for
mca
didn't
sell
nearly
as
well
as
his
epic
albums
but
his
albums
usually
were
critically
acclaimed
in
1995
he
reunited
with
wynette
to
record
one
in
april
of
1996
jones
published
his
autobiography
i
lived
to
tell
it
all
in
1998
he
returned
with
another
studio
album
it
don't
get
any
better
than
this
following
the
release
of
it
don't
get
any
better
than
this
jones
moved
from
mca
to
elektra/asylum
who
signed
him
on
the
provision
that
he
would
record
hardcore
country
music
jones
was
completing
work
on
his
debut
for
the
label
when
he
crashed
his
car
into
a
bridge
in
nashville
on
march
6
1999
critically
injuring
himself
amazingly
he
pulled
through
the
accident
but
the
investigation
proved
that
jones
had
been
drinking
and
driving
â€”
a
troubling
revelation
given
his
long
history
with
alcoholism
he
