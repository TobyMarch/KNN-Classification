[edit]
a
founding
member
of
commander
venus
–
which
disbanded
in
1997
–
guitarist/vocalist
conor
oberst
turned
to
focus
on
his
new
project
bright
eyes
in
1998
he
released
20
of
the
songs
he
had
been
stockpiling
as
the
first
official
bright
eyes
album
a
collection
of
songs
written
and
recorded
19951997[3]
the
album
saw
oberst
beginning
to
experiment
with
drum
machines
keyboards
and
other
instruments
the
sound
of
the
album
ranges
from
bleating
vocals
to
acoustic
guitar
songs
and
technostyle
synthesizer
instrumentals
critical
reaction
was
negative
with
allmusic
saying
that
many
of
the
songs
disintegrate
as
his
vocals
are
reduced
to
the
unintelligible
babbling
of
a
child
any
balance
the
music
maintained
up
to
that
point
however
fragile
is
lost
and
so
more
than
likely
is
the
listener[4]
letting

(1998)
[edit]
on

saddle
creek
released
letting
off
the
happiness
a
tentrack
album
that
boasted
a
more
focused
and
clearer
sound
than
the
previous
album
according
to
the
saddle
creek
press
release
it
features
members
of
lullaby
for
the
working
class
neutral
milk
hotel
and
of
montreal
park
ave
bandmate
neely

also
contributed

it
was
predominantly
recorded
in

basement
in

on

analog
eight

with
some
work
also
done
at

studio[5]
although
almost
all
of
the
tracks
feature
a
full
band

with
only
acoustic

and
vocals
padraic
my
prince
gives
a
dramatic
fictional
account
of
the
death
of
his
baby
brother
a
story
with
a
multitude
of
symbolic
meanings
oberst
has
referenced
the
song
padraic
my
prince
more
than
once
in
his
music
the
song
an
attempt
to
tip
the
scales
on
the
album
fevers
and
mirrors
has
a
faux
interview
near
the
end
of
the
track
the
interview
was
completely
faked
it
was
not
oberst
speaking
it
is
actually
todd
fink
(formerly
known
as
todd
baechle)
who
was
a
labelmate
and
had
played
in
other
bands
with
oberst
the
interviewer
is
matt
silcock
another
labelmate
on
saddle
creek
records
the
interview
was
meant
to
be
somewhat
sarcastic
and
most
of
what
the
oberst
impersonator
said
was
not
true
at
one
point
the
interviewer
asks
the
question
so
some
of
these
references
like
babies
in
bathtubs
are
not
biographical?
and
the
oberst
impersonator
replies
well
i
did
have
a
brother
who
died
in
a
bathtub



he
drowned
well
actually
i
had
five
brothers
that
drowned
no
i'm
serious
my
mother
drowned
one
every
year
for
five
consecutive
years
they
were
all
named
padraic
and
that's
why
they
only
got
one
song
it's
kind
of
like
walking
out
a
door
and
discovering
that
it's
a
window[6]
oberst
also
references
the
song
in
cartoon
blues
on
the
four
winds
ep
every
day
and
every
night
ep
(1999)
[edit]
in
november
1999
bright
eyes
released
the
fivesong
every
day
and
every
night
ep
which
included
neely
o'hara
and
a
perfect
sonnet
fevers
and

(2000)
[edit]
in
2000
bright
eyes
released
fevers
and

with
new
instruments
such
as
the
flute
piano
and
accordion
introduced
into
the
song
arrangements
after
an
attempt
to
tip
the
scales
there
is
a
mock
radio
interview
that
features
todd
fink
of
the
faint
doing
an
impression
of
oberst
while
reading
a
script
that
oberst
wrote
in
this
interview
the
fake
oberst
presents
a
strange
contradictory
explanation
of
his
attitude
towards
his
music
it
acknowledges
criticisms
of
his
lyrics
as
overblown
and
insincere
which
had
begun
to
appear
as
the
popularity
of
the
band
increased
but
responds
by
stating
that
the
lyrics
are
meant
for
personal
interpretation
oberst
later
commented
that
it
was
a
way
to
make
fun
of
ourselves
because
the
record
is
such
a
downer
i
mean
that's
one
part
of
who
i
am
but
i
also
like
laughing[7]

oberst
stated
that
before
making
this
record
both
he
and
mike
mogis
had
an
idea
for
a
sort
of
grandiose
sound
that
neither
could
really
put
into

this
was
also

the
decision

the
sound

moves
away
from
the
folk
sound
that
the

had
accomplished
on
previous
records
we're
over
the
americana
rootsy
whatever
that
sound
is
people
say
country
but
i
never
thought
we
were
very
country
at
all
but
whatever
that
element
is
or
that
aesthetic
is
i
guess
it's
worn
a
little
thin
for
me
these
days
so
we
very
much
wanted
it
to
be
rocking
and
for
lack
of
a
better
term
contemporary
or
modern[29]
