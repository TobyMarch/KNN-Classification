early
life
[edit]
eric
patrick
clapton
was
born
in
ripley
surrey
england
the
son
of
16yearold
patricia
molly
clapton
(b
7
january
1929
d
march
1999)
and
edward
walter
fryer
(21
march
1920
–
15
may
1985)
a
25yearold
soldier
from
montreal
quebec[10]
fryer
shipped
off
to
war
prior
to
clapton's
birth
and
then
returned
to
canada
clapton
grew
up
with
his
grandmother
rose
and
her
second
husband
jack
clapp
who
was
stepfather
to
patricia
clapton
and
her
brother
adrian
believing
they
were
his
parents
and
that
his
mother
was
actually
his
older
sister
the
similarity
in
surnames
gave
rise
to
the
erroneous
belief
that
clapton's
real
surname
is
clapp
(reginald
cecil
clapton
was
the
name
of
rose's
first
husband
eric
clapton's
maternal
grandfather)[11]
years
later
his
mother
married
another
canadian
soldier
and
moved
to
germany[12]
leaving
young
eric
with
his
grandparents
in
surrey[13]
clapton
received
an
acoustic
hoyer
guitar
made
in
germany
for
his
thirteenth
birthday
but
the
inexpensive
steelstringed
instrument
was
difficult
to
play
and
he
briefly
lost
interest[13]
two
years
later
clapton
picked
it
up
again
and
started
playing
consistently[13]
clapton
was
influenced
by
the
blues
from
an
early
age
and
practised
long
hours
to
learn
the
chords
of
blues
music
by
playing
along
to
the
records[14]
he
preserved
his
practice
sessions
using
his
portable
grundig
reeltoreel
tape
recorder
listening
to
them
over
and
over
until
he
felt
he'd
got
it
right[14][15]
in
1961
after
leaving
hollyfield
school
in
surbiton
clapton
studied
at
the
kingston
college
of
art
but
was
dismissed
at
the
end
of
the
academic
year
because
his
focus
remained
on
music
rather
than
art
his
guitar
playing
was
so
advanced
that
by
the
age
of
16
he
was
getting
noticed[15]
around
this
time
clapton
began
busking
around
kingston
richmond
and
the
west
end[16]
in
1962
clapton
started
performing
as
a
duo
with
fellow
blues
enthusiast
david
brock
in
pubs
around
surrey[15]
when
he
was
seventeen
years
old
clapton
joined
his
first
band
an
early
british
rb
group
the
roosters
whose
other
guitarist
was
tom
mcguinness
he
stayed
with
this
band
from
january
through
august
1963[17]
in
october
of
that
year
clapton
did
a
sevengig

the

in
october
1963
clapton
joined
the
yardbirds
a
bluesinfluenced
rock
and
roll
band
and
stayed
with
them
until
march
1965
synthesising
influences
from
chicago
blues
and
leading
blues
guitarists
such
as
buddy
guy
freddie

and
b

clapton
forged
a
distinctive
style
and
rapidly
became
one
of
the
most
talkedabout
guitarists
in
the
british
music
scene[18]
the
band
initially
played
chess/checker/veejay
blues
numbers
and
began
to
attract
a
large
cult
following
when
they
took
over
the
rolling
stones'
residency
at
the
crawdaddy
club
in
richmond
they
toured
england
with
american
bluesman
sonny
boy
williamson
ii
a
joint
lp
album
recorded
in
december
1963
was
issued
in
1965
since
appearing
at
the
royal
albert
hall
for
the
first
time
in
1964
clapton
has
performed
at
the
venue
almost
200
times
it
was
during
this
time
period
that
clapton's
yardbirds
rhythm
guitarist
chris
dreja
recalled
that
whenever
clapton
broke
a
guitar
string
during
a
concert
he
would
stay
on
stage
and
replace
it
the
english
audiences
would
wait
out
the
delay
by
doing
what
is
called
a
slow
handclap
clapton
told
his
official
biographer
ray
coleman
that
my
nickname
of
'slowhand'
came
from
giorgio
gomelsky
he
coined
it
as
a
good
pun
he
kept
saying
i
was
a
fast
player
so
he
put
together
the
slow
handclap
phrase
into
slowhand
as
a
play
on
words[19]
in
december
1964
clapton
made
his
first
appearance
at
the
royal
albert
hall
london
with
the
yardbirds
since
then
clapton
has
performed
at
the
hall
almost
200
times
and
has
stated
that
performing
at
the
venue
is
like
playing
in
my
front
room[20][21]
in
march
1965
the
yardbirds
had
their
first
major
hit
for
your
love
on
which
clapton
played
guitar
the
yardbirds
elected
to
move
toward
a
poporiented
sound
in
part
because
of
the
success
of
for
your
love
written
by
pop
songwriterforhire
graham
gouldman
(who
would
achieve
success
as
a
member
of
10cc)
who
had
also
written
hit
songs
for
herman's
hermits
and
the
hollies
still
musically
devoted
to
the
blues
clapton
was
opposed
to
the
move
and
left
the
band
he
recommended
fellow
guitarist
jimmy
page
as
his
replacement
but
page
declined
out
of
loyalty
to
clapton[22]
putting
jeff
beck
forward[18]
while
beck
and
page
played
together
in
the
yardbirds
the
trio
of
beck
page
and
clapton
were
never
in
the
group
together
however
the
trio
did
appear
on
the
12date
benefit
tour
for
action
for
research
into
multiple
sclerosis
in
1983
clapton
joined
john
mayall

the
bluesbreakers
in
april
1965
only
to
quit
a
few
months
later
in
the
summer
of
1965
he
left
for
greece
with
a
band
called
the
glands
which
included
his
old
friend
ben
palmer
on
piano
in
november
1965
he
rejoined
john
mayall
during
his
second
bluesbreakers
stint
clapton
gained
a
reputation
as
the
best
blues
guitarist
on
the
club
circuit
although
clapton
gained
world
fame
for
his
playing
on
the
influential
album
blues
breakers
–
john
mayall
–
with
eric
clapton
this
album
was
not
released
until
he
had
left
the
band
for
the
last
time
having
swapped
his
fender
telecaster
and
vox
ac30
amplifier
for
a
1960
gibson
les
paul
standard
guitar
and
marshall
amplifier
clapton's
sound
and
playing
inspired
a
wellpublicised
graffito
that
deified
him
with
the
famous
slogan
clapton
is
god
the
phrase
was
spraypainted
by
an
admirer
on
a
wall
in
an
islington
underground
station
in
the
autumn
of
1967
the
graffiti
was
captured
in
a
nowfamous
photograph
in
which
a
dog
is
urinating
on
the
wall
clapton
is
reported
to
have
been
embarrassed
by
the
slogan
saying
in
his
the
south
bank
show
profile
in
1987
i
never
accepted
that
i
was
the
greatest
guitar
player
in
the
world
i
always
wanted
to
be
the
greatest
guitar
player
in
the
world
but
that's
an
ideal
and
i
accept
it
as
an
ideal
the
phrase
began
to
appear
in
other
areas
of
islington
throughout
the
mid1960s[23]

his
time
with

of

and
wrote
the

of

clapton
(right)
with
cream
by
early

as
fans
of
the
emerging
bluesrock
sound
in
britain
had
begun
to
portray
clapton
as
britain's
top
guitarist
however
he
found
himself
rivalled
by
the
emergence
of
jimi
hendrix
an
acid
rockinfused
guitarist
who
used
wailing

and
effects
pedals
to
create
new

hendrix's
arrival
had
an
immediate
and
major
effect
on

visited

varied
from

disraeli

clapton's
the

months

–
a
live
version
of
robert
johnson's
cross
road
blues
though
cream
was
hailed
as
one
of
the
greatest
groups
of
its
day
and
the
adulation
of
clapton
as
a
guitar
legend
reached
new
heights
the
supergroup
was
shortlived
drug
and
alcohol
use
escalated
tension
between
the
three
members
and
conflicts
between
bruce
and
baker
eventually
led
to
cream's
demise
a
strongly
critical
rolling
stone
review
of
a
concert
of
the
group's
second
headlining
us
tour
was
another
significant
factor
in
the
trio's
demise
and
it
affected
clapton
profoundly[25]
cream's
farewell
album
goodbye
featuring
live
performances
recorded
at
the
forum
los
angeles
19
october
1968
was
released
shortly
after

disbanded
it
also
featured
the

cowritten
by
clapton
and
george
harrison
clapton
met
harrison
and
became
friends
with
him
after
the
beatles
shared
a
bill
with
the
claptonera
yardbirds
at
the
london
palladium
the
close
friendship
between
clapton
and
harrison
resulted
in
clapton
playing
on
harrison's
while
my
guitar
gently
weeps
from
the
beatles'
white
album
(1968)
harrison
also
released
his
solo
debut
album
wonderwall
music
in
1968
it
became
the
first
of
many
harrison
solo
records
to
feature
clapton
on
guitar
clapton
would
go
largely
uncredited
for
his
contributions
to
harrison's
albums
due
to
contractual
restraints
the
pair
would
often
play
live
together
as
each
other's
guest
a
year
after
harrison's
death
in
2001
clapton
helped
organise
a
tribute
concert
for
which
he
was
musical
director[26]
in
1969
when
the
beatles
were
recording/filming
what
became
let
it
be
tensions
became
so
acute
that
harrison
quit
the
group
for
several
days
prompting
the
others
to
consider
replacing
him
with
clapton
an
idea
that
particularly
appealed
to
john
lennon
who
was
captured
on
tape
saying
that
if
george
doesn’t
come
back
by
monday
or
tuesday
we
ask
eric
clapton
to
play
and
that
this
would
be
congenial
to
clapton
in

on
the

of

there
may
have
been
[a

would

join

the
problem
with
that
was
i
had
bonded

was
developing

with

exclusive

i
think
it
fitted
a
need
of

mine
that
he
could
elevate
himself
by
having
this

that
could
be

to

lennon
would
use
my
name
every
now
and
then
for
clout
as
if
i
was

gun
so
i
don’t
think
i
could
have
been
brought
into

was

the
intention
of
counteracting
the
star
cult
faction
that
had
begun
to
form
around
him
clapton
assembled
a
new
band
composed
of
delaney
and
bonnie's
former
rhythm
section
bobby
whitlock
as
keyboardist
and
vocalist
carl
radle
as
the
bassist
and
drummer
jim
gordon
with
clapton
playing
guitar
it
was
his
intention
to
show
that
he
need
not
fill
a
starring
role
and
functioned
well
as
a
member
of
an
ensemble[35]
during
this
period
clapton
was
increasingly
influenced
by
the
band
and
their
album
music
from
big
pink
saying
what
i
appreciated
about
the
band
was
that
they
were
more
concerned
with
songs
and
singing
they
would
have
three
and
fourpart
harmonies
and
the
guitar
was
put
back
into
perspective
as
being
accompaniment
that
suited
me
well
because
i
had
gotten
so
tired
of
the
virtuosity—or
pseudovirtuosity—thing
of
long
boring
guitar
solos
just
because
they
were
expected
the
band
brought
things
back
into
perspective
the
priority
was
the
song[36]
clapton
(right)
with
derek
and
the
dominos
the
band
was
originally
called
eric
clapton
and
friends
the
name
derek
and
the
dominos
was
a
fluke
that
occurred
when
the
band's
provisional
name
of
del
and
the
dynamos
was
misread
as
derek
and
the
dominos[37]
clapton's
biography
states
that
tony
ashton
of
ashton
gardner
and
dyke
told
clapton
to
call
the
band
del
and
the
dominos
since
del
was
his
nickname
for
eric
clapton
del
and
eric
were
combined
and
the
final
name
became
derek
and
the
dominos[38]
clapton's
close
friendship
with
george
harrison
brought
him
into
contact
with
harrison's
wife
pattie
boyd
with
whom
he
became
deeply
infatuated
when
she
spurned
his
advances
clapton's
unrequited
affections
prompted
most
of
the
material
for
the
dominos'
album

nizami

the
story
of
layla
and
majnun
a
copy
of
which
ian
dallas
had
given
to
clapton
the
book
moved
clapton
profoundly
as
it
was
the
tale
of
a
young
man
who
fell
hopelessly
in
love
with
a
beautiful
unavailable
woman
and
who
went
crazy
because
he
could
not
marry
her[39][40]
the
two
parts
of
layla
were
recorded
in
separate
sessions
the
opening
guitar
section
was
recorded
first
and
for
the
second
section
laid
down

months

the

was

tragedy
dogged
the
group
throughout
its
brief
career
during
the
sessions
clapton
was
devastated
by
news
of
the
death
of
jimi
hendrix
eight
days
previously
the
band
had
cut
a
cover
of
little
wing
as
a
tribute
to
hendrix
on
17
september
1970
one
day
before
hendrix's
death
clapton
had
purchased
a
lefthanded
fender
stratocaster
that
he
had
planned
to
give
to
hendrix
as
a
birthday
gift
adding
to
clapton's
woes
the
layla
album
received
only
lukewarm
reviews
upon
release
the
shaken
group
undertook
a
us
tour
without
allman
who
had
returned
to
the
allman
brothers
band
despite
clapton's
later
admission
that
the
tour
took
place
amidst
a
veritable
blizzard
of
drugs
and
alcohol
it
resulted
in
the
live
double
album
in
concert[42]
the
band
had
recorded
several
tracks
for
a
second
album
in
london
during
the
spring
of
1971
(five
of
which
were
released
on
the
eric
clapton
boxset
crossroads)
but
the
results
were
mediocre
a
second
record
was
in
the
works
when
a
clashing
of
egos
took
place
and
clapton
walked
thus
disbanding
the
group
allman
was
killed
in
a
motorcycle
accident
on
29
october
1971
clapton
wrote
later
in
his
autobiography
that
he
and
allman
were
inseparable
during
the
sessions
in
florida
he
talked
about
allman
as
the
musical
brother
i'd
never
had
but
wished
i
did[43]
although
radle
would
remain
clapton's
bass
player
until
the
summer
of
1979
(radle
died
in
may
1980
from
the
effects
of
alcohol
and
narcotics)
it
would
be
2003
before
clapton
and
whitlock
appeared
together
again
(clapton
guested
on
whitlock's
appearance
on
the
later
with
jools
holland
show)
another
tragic
footnote
to
the
dominos
story
was
the
fate
of
drummer
jim
gordon
who
was
an
undiagnosed
schizophrenic
and
years
later
murdered
his
mother
during
a
psychotic
episode
gordon
was
confined
to
16yearstolife
imprisonment
later
being
moved
to
a
mental
institution
where
he
remains
today[18]
personal
challenges
and
early
solo
success
[edit]
clapton's
career
successes
in
the
1970s
were
in
stark
contrast
with
the
struggles
he
coped
with
in
his
personal
life
which
was
troubled
by
romantic
longings
and
drug
and
alcohol
addiction[44]
he
became
infatuated
with
pattie
boyd
who
at
the
time
was
married
to
close
friend
george
harrison
he
withdrew
from
recording
and
touring
as
the
band
broke
up
to
isolation
in
his
surrey
england
residence
there
he
nursed
a
heroin
addiction
which
resulted
in
a
lengthy
career
hiatus
interrupted
only
by
the
concert
for
bangladesh
in
august
1971
(where
he
passed
out
on
stage
was
revived
and
managed
to
finish
his
performance)[18]
in
january
1973
the

organised
a
comeback
concert
for
clapton
at
london's
rainbow
theatre
aptly
titled
the

help
clapton
kick
his
addiction
clapton
would
return
the
favour
by
playing
'the

in

version
of
the
who's

in

his
appearance
in

(performing

is
notable
as
he
is
clearly
wearing
a
fake

result
of
deciding
to
shave
off
his

eventually
told
him
the
truth
about
his
parentage
he
only
knew
that
his

name
was
edward
fryer
this
was
a
source
of
disquiet
for
clapton
as
witnessed
by
his
1998
song
my
father's
eyes
a
montreal
journalist

michael

pieced
together
the
story
he
learned
that
clapton's
father
was
edward
walter
fryer
born
21
march
1920
in
montreal
and
died
15
may
1985

ontario
fryer
was
a
musician
(piano
and
saxophone)
and
a
lifelong
drifter
who
was
married
several
times
had
several
children

apparently
never
knew

was
the

clapton's
choice
of
electric
guitars
has
been
as
notable
as
the
man
himself
alongside
hank
marvin
the
beatles
and
jimi
hendrix
clapton
exerted
a
crucial
and

paul
guitar
from

store

commented

paul
standard
was
stolen

woman
tone
[edit]
the
woman
tone
is
the
informal
term
used
by
clapton
to
refer
to
his
distinctive
mid
to
late1960s
electric
guitar
sound
created
using
his
gibson
sg
solid
body
guitar
(with
humbucker
pickups)
and
a
marshall
tube
amplifier[110]
it
is
an
overdriven
sound
that
is
articulate
yet
thick
it
is
characterised
by
being
quite
distorted
(or
even
achieved
with
a
fuzz)
but
muted
in
contrast
to
the
bright
and
twangy
distortion
that
most
guitarists
were
using
at
the
time
among
the
techniques
used
to
replicate
clapton's
sound
is
a
technique
by
which
the
amplifier's
volume
is
turned
up
to
full
while
the
guitar's
tone
knob
is
turned
down
to
zero
or
one[111]
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
woman
tone
is
clapton's
famous
riff
and
solo
from
cream's
1967
hit
sunshine
of
your
love
clapton
has
explained
that
he
obtained
the
tone
with
his
gibson's
tone
control
rolled
all
the
way
down
switching
the
neck
pickup
(closest
to
the
fretboard)
and
the
volume
all
the
way
up
with
his
distortion
turned
all
the
way
up
the
treble
mids
and
bass
controls
on
the
amplifier
were
also
maxed
out
some
versions
of
the
woman
tone
may
also
have
involved
strategic
positioning
of
clapton's
wahwah
pedal[citation

pursuits
such
as
fishing
and
shooting
he
supports
the
alliance's
pursuit
to

with
the
state's
interference
with

private
pursuits[121]
in

he

controversy
over
remarks
on
immigration
[edit]
on
5
august
1976
clapton
provoked
an
uproar
and
lingering
controversy
when
he
spoke
out
against
increasing
immigration
during
a
concert
in
birmingham
visibly
intoxicated
clapton
voiced
his
support
of
controversial
political
candidate
enoch
powell
and
announced
on
stage
that
britain
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
black
colony
clapton
was
quoted
as
saying
i
think
enoch's
right

we
should
send
them
all
back
throw
the
wogs
out!
keep
britain
white![122]
the
latter
phrase
was
at
the
time
a
british
national
front
slogan[123]
clapton
continued
i
used
to
be
into
dope
now
i’m
into
racism

this
incident
along
with
some
controversial
remarks
made
around
the
same
time
by
david
bowie
as
well
as
uses
of
nazirelated
imagery
by
sid
vicious
and
siouxsie
sioux
were
the
main
catalysts
for
the
creation
of
rock
against
racism
which
occurred
on
30
april
1978[125]
in
response
to
the
comments
rock
photographer
red
saunders
and
others
published
an
open
letter
in
nme
melody
maker
sounds
and
the
socialist
worker
it
read
come
on
eric
own
up
half
your
music
is
black
you're
rock
music's
biggest
colonist
it
concluded
ps
who
shot
the
sheriff
eric?
it
sure
as
hell
wasn't
you![125]
in
an
interview
from
october
1976
with
sounds
magazine
clapton
remarked
i
thought
it
was
quite
funny
actually
i
don't
know
much
about
politics
i
don't
even
know
if
it
would
be
good
or
bad
for
him
to
get
in
i
don't
even
know
who
the
prime
minister
is
now
i
just
don't
know
what
came
over
me
that
night
it
must
have
been
something
that
happened
in
the
day
but
it
came
out
in
this
garbled
thing
i
thought
the
whole
thing
was
like
monty
python
there's
this
rock
group
playing
onstage
and
the
singer
starts
talking
about
politics
it's
so
stupid
those
people
who
paid
their
money
sittin'
listening
to
this
madman
dribbling
on
and
the
band
meanwhile
getting
fidgety
thinking
'oh
dear'[126]
in
a
2004
interview
with
uncut
clapton
referred
to
powell
as
outrageously
brave
and
stated
that
his
feeling
about
this
has
not
changed
because
the
uk
is
still

inviting
people
in
as
cheap
labour
and
then
putting
them
in
ghettos
in
2004
clapton
told
an
interviewer
for
scotland
on
sunday
there's
no
way
i
could
be
a
racist
it
would
make
no
sense[127]
in
his
2007
autobiography
clapton
called
himself
deliberately
oblivious
to
it
all
and
wrote
i
had
never
really
understood
or
been
directly
affected
by
racial
conflict

when
i
listened
to
music
i
was
disinterested
in
where
the
players
came
from
or
what
colour
their
skin
was
interesting
then
that
10
years
later
i
would
be
labelled
a
racist

since
then
i
have
learnt
to
keep
my
opinions
to
myself
of
course
it
might
also
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
pattie
had
just
been
leered
at
by
a
member
of
the
saudi
royal
family[128]
in
a
december
2007
interview
with
melvyn
bragg
on
the
south
bank
show
clapton
reiterated
his
support
for
enoch
powell
and
again
denied
that
powell's
views
were
racist[129]
