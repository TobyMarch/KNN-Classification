the
fact
that
so
many
young
people
who
were'nt
even
born
yet
then
appreciate
the
music
of
the
80s
just
proves
my
point
that
i've
always
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
times
for
music
ever
i
knew
it
then
as
it
was
happening

i
like
henley's
song
boys
of
summer
but
the
rest
of
his
solo
work
sucks
his
voice
and
annoying
production
gets
a
thumbs
down
