eric
clapton
by
the
time
eric
clapton
launched
his
solo
career
with
the
release
of
his
selftitled
debut
album
in
mid1970
he
was
long
established
as
one
of
the
world's
major
rock
stars
due
to
his
group
affiliations

the
yardbirds
john
mayall's
bluesbreakers
cream
and
blind
faith

which
had
demonstrated
his
claim
to
being
the
best
rock
guitarist
of
his
generation
that
it
took
clapton
so
long
to
go
out
on
his
own
however
was
evidence
of
a
degree
of
reticence
unusual
for
one
of
his
stature
and
his
debut
album
though
it
spawned
the
top
40
hit
after
midnight
was
typical
of
his
selfeffacing
approach
it
was
in
effect
an
album
by
the
group
he
had
lately
been
featured
in
delaney

bonnie

friends
not
surprisingly
before
his
solo
debut
had
even
been
released
clapton
had
retreated
from
his
solo
stance
assembling
from
the
dbf
ranks
the
personnel
for
a
group
derek

the
dominos
with
whom
he
played
for
most
of
1970
and
recorded
the
landmark
album
layla
and
other
assorted
love
songs
clapton
was
largely
inactive
in
1971
and
1972
due
to
heroin
addiction
but
he
performed
a
comeback
concert
at
the
rainbow
theatre
in
london
on
january
13
1973
resulting
in
the
album
eric
clapton's
rainbow
concert
(september
1973)
but
clapton
did
not
launch
a
sustained
solo
career
until
july
1974
when
he
released
461
ocean
boulevard
which
topped
the
charts
and
spawned
the
number
one
single
i
shot
the
sheriff
the
persona
clapton
established
over
the
next
decade
was
less
that
of
guitar
hero
than
arena
rock
star
with
a
weakness
for
ballads
the
followups
to
461
ocean
boulevard
there's
one
in
every
crowd
(march
1975)
the
live
ec
was
here
(august
1975)
and
no
reason
to
cry
(august
1976)
were
less
successful
but
slowhand
(november
1977)
which
featured
both
the
powerful
cocaine
(written
by
jj
cale
who
had
also
written
after
midnight)
and
the
hit
singles
lay
down
sally
and
wonderful
tonight
was
a
millionseller
its
followups
backless
(november
1978)
featuring
the
top
ten
hit
promises
the
live
just
one
night
(april
1980)
and
another
ticket
(february
1981)
featuring
the
top
ten
hit
i
can't
stand
it
were
all
big
sellers
clapton's
popularity
waned
somewhat
in
the
first
half
of
the
'80s
as
the
albums
money
and
cigarettes
(february
1983)
behind
the
sun
(march
1985)
and
august
(november
1986)
indicated
a
certain
career
stasis
but
he
was
buoyed
up
by
the
release
of
the
box
set
retrospective
crossroads
(april
1988)
which
seemed
to
remind
his
fans
of
how
great
he
was
journeyman
(november
1989)
was
a
return
to
form
it
would
be
his
last
new
studio
album
for
nearly
five
years
though
in
the
interim
he
would
suffer
greatly
and
enjoy
surprising
triumph
on
march
20
1991
clapton's
fouryearold
son
was
killed
in
a
fall
while
he
mourned
he
released
a
live
album
24
nights
(october
1991)
culled
from
his
annual
concert
series
at
royal
albert
hall
in
london
and
prepared
a
movie
soundtrack
rush
(january
1992)
the
soundtrack
featured
a
song
written
for
his
son
tears
in
heaven
that
became
a
massive
hit
single
in
march
1992
clapton
recorded
a
concert
for
mtv
unplugged
which
when
released
on
an
album
in
august
became
his
biggestselling
record
ever
two
years
later
clapton
returned
with
a
blues
album
from
the
cradle
which
became
one
of
his
most
successful
albums
both
commercially
and
critically
crossroads
vol
2
live
in
the
seventies
a
box
set
chronicling
his
live
work
from
the
'70s
was
released
to
mixed
reviews
in
early
1997
clapton
billing
himself
by
the
pseudonym

with
keyboardist/producer
simon

as
the
ambient
new
age
and
triphop
duo
tdf
the
duo
released

therapy
to
mixed

in

clapton
retained
climie
as
his
collaborator
for
pilgrim
his
first
album
of
new
material
since
1989's
journeyman
pilgrim
was
greeted
with
decidedly
mixed
reviews
upon
its
spring
1998
release
but
the
album
debuted
at
number
four
and
stayed
in
the
top
ten
for
several
weeks
on
the
success
of
the
single
my
father's
eyes
in
2000
clapton
teamed
up
with
old
friend
bb
king
on
riding

a
collection
of
tunes
honoring
the
mississippiborn
bluesman
robert
johnson
released
in

back
home
clapton's
14th

his
ease
with
fatherhood
also
in

clapton
unexpectedly
teamed
with
jack

and
ginger

for
a
cream
reunion
that
included
may
concerts
at
londons
royal
albert
hall
and
shows
at
new
yorks
madison
square
garden
in
october
with
the
former
being
compiled
for
a
live
release
that
fall
this
turned
out
to
be
the
first
of
many
reunions
and
looks
back
for
clapton
in
2006
he
elevated
the
profile
of
his
latterday
idol
jj
cale
by
recording
an
albumlong
duet
the
road
to
escondido
the
following
year
he
released
his
autobiography

accompanied
by
a
new
career
compilation
called
the
complete
clapton

which
focused
more
on
his
trials
with
addiction
and
subsequent
recovery
than
his
musical
career
in
2008
clapton
began
playing
regular
shows
with
his
old
blind
faith
partner
steve
winwood
gigs

returned
the

i
read
once
that
if
you
asked
any
layman
to
name
a
guitarist
he
would
say
eric
clapton
so
i
polled
some
people



i
got
alex
lifeson
carlos
santana
jimi
hendrix
and
eric
johnson
but
no
