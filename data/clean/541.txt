and
djembe[7]
at
age

he
moved
with
his
family
to
union
city
new
jersey[8]
splitting
his
time
between
the
united
states
and
senegal
until
settling
in
newark
new
jersey[7]
growing
up
in
new
jersey
akon
had
difficulties
getting
along
with
other
children
when
he
and
his
older
brother
reached
high
school
his
parents
left
them
on
their
own
in

georgia[9]
akon
has
stated
in
interviews
that
his
full
name
is
aliaune
damala
akon
thiam
and
that
as
a
muslim
he
has
never
drunk
alcohol
or
smoked[10]
although
there
is
some
ambiguity
and
debate
about
akon's
legal
name
and
birth
date
akon
is
usually
credited
as
aliaune
thiam[11][12]
in
addition
to
the

form
akon's
full
name
has
been
reported
both
as
aliaune
badara
thiam
and

issues
against

by
the
county
of
dutchess
new
york[14]
in
regards
to
his
birth
date
akon
is
very
protective
of

discovery
and
trouble
[edit]
akon's
alleged
three
years
in
jail
saw
him
begin
to
recognize
his
music
abilities
and
develop
an
appreciation
for
his
musical
background
music
mogul
devyne

about
akon
when
the
rapper
lil'
zane
brought
him
along
to
stephens'
rehearsal
hall
a
place
that
at
the
time
saw
talents
such
as
usher
and
tlc
being

the
relationship
between
stephens
and
akon
began
as
a
friendship
and
mentorship
with
the
young

regularly
stopping
by

advice
but
when
akon
lost
his

that
he
was
part

and
spent
three
years
in
prison
from
1999

however
in
april
2008
the
smoking
gun
website
challenged
his
claim
with
court
records
and
interviews
with
detectives
involved
in
akon's
case
concluding
that
he
was
not
convicted
of
any
crime
and
did
not
serve
time
in
prison[44][45][46]
akon
responded
to
the
report
by
saying
that
he
never
spent
3
years
in
prison
consecutively
but
had
many
shorter
sentences
that
add
up

three
years[47]

drew
criticism
for
an

included
simulated
sex
with
a
15yearold
girl
at
a
club
in
trinidad
and
tobago
as
part

fake
contest
despite

club's
claim
to
have
a
21
years
and
over
age
requirement[48][49]
the

stefani[50]
however

rather
simply

the
