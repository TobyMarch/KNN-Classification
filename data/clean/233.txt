farrell
said
“i

a
few
songs
right
now
written
and
we
may
when
i
go
home
write
a
few
more
not
an
entire
album
although
we
have
enough
material
for
that”
“etty
my
wife
and
i
also
do
house
music”
farrell
continued
“i
have
an
entire
album’s
worth
of
house
music
that
is
part
of
an
immersive

called
‘kind
heaven’
that
will
be
out
next
year”
will
there
be
new
jane’s
addiction
music
as
well?
“jane’s
addiction
may
be
included
in
that
play”
farrell
said
“i
have
four
or
five
songs
that
i
need
a
group
to
record
so
it
will
either
be
with
jane’s
addiction
or
it
might
be
with
some
other
amazing
people”
