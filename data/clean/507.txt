i
am
not
a
fan
of
country
music
it's
just
something
i
really
haven't
enjoyed
listening
to
in
the
past
every
once
in
awhile
i
hear
a
country
tune
that
i
enjoy
but
for
the
most
part
i
don't
like
listening
to
that
style
of
music
however
i
grew
up
not
too
far
from
pocahontas
illinois
and
here
for
the
party
is
one
of
the
biggest
things
to
happen
in
my
old
stomping
grounds
in
a
long
time
so
i
decided
i
would
both
support
the
local
girl
done
good
and
find
out
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
was
quite
surprised
wilson's
songs
and
music
are
country
but
with
a
twist
she
has
successfully
combined
the
sensibility
and
earthiness
of
old
style
country
lyrics
with
a
modern
sound
that
is
fresh
instead
of
stale
like
most
new
sounds
are
there
are
traces
of
gospel
folk
and
even
a
hint
of
blues
in
her
music
the
two
songs
i
enjoy
on
the
album
most
are
chariot
and
pocahontas
proud
i
really
enjoyed
listening
to
this
album
and
if
i
can
find
more
music
like
gretchen
wilson's
perhaps
i'll
be
more
open
to
listening
to
country
music
in
the
future

cd
gretchen
wilson
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
country
music
it's
the
difference
between
listening
to
a
real
natural
talent
who
can
sing
her
heart
out
vs
listening
to
a
fake
barbie
doll
with
a
manufactured
sound
nashville
has
been
churning
out
pure
mush
for
the
last
decade
and
they
lost
me
to
the
texas
music
scene
but
gretchen
proves
that
raw
talent
can
still
kick
the
door
open
in
nashville
and
i
am
glad
she
did

it's
fun
and
energizing

gretchen
your
great

go
girl!

ok
antigretchen
wilsoners

y'all
say
she
ain't
polished
and
all
nashvilleshiny
enough
well
duh!?!?!?
she's
jus'
a
lil'
ol'
redneck
girl!
i'm
from
southern
illinois

about
60
miles
from
her
hometown

so
i
automatically
love
her
but
seriously
what's
great
about
her
and
her
lyrics
are
that
they
come
from
the
way
she
was
raised
and
grew
up
she
pulled
herself
up
by
her
own
britches
and
she
sings
about
it
if
that
ain't
country
music
at
it's
finest
roots
then
y'all
jus'
ain't
been
listening
long
enough
she's
good
damned
good
she
ain't
shenayya
and
she
ain't
faith
she's
her
own
woman
singing
her
own
lyrics
it's
nice
not
to
have
nashville
rammed
down
our
gullets

for
a
change

by
being
able
to
buy
something
new
and
innovative
instead
of
another
of
canned
country
du
jour
you
go
girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

who
would
have
thought
gretchen
wilson
would
score
a
#1
album
for
here
for
the
party?
well
she
didand
here's
why
she's
got
a
good
voice
she
doesn't
get
swept
up
in
the
hum
drums
of
country
honky
tonk
life
and
she
keeps
her
album
fun!
yes
i
said
itfun!
i
think
a
lot
of
people
like
her
because
she
likes
to
have
a
good
timeand
with
the
way
the
world
is
todaywe
need
some
music
like
that
every
now
and
then
while
she
does
sound
similar
to
many
of
the
other
country
ladies
out
there
today
i
find
that
she
tells
it
like
it
isjust
like
her
comparison
of
two
retailers
in
her
monster
hit
redneck
woman
who
else
would
have
thought
of
that???
all
i
have
to
say
is
you
go
girl!
i
hope
the
next
outing
from
ms
wilson
will
be
this
much
fun
if
it
is
we
better
block
off
a
whole
city
section
for
this
partyit's
too
hot
to
handle!

cd
it
is
nice
to
know
that
we
finally
have
a
good
country
cd
out
this
year
i
love
it
songs
like
pocahontas
proud
redneck
woman
and
here
for
the
party
really
rock
gretchen
wilson
really
reminds
me
of
a
1995
shania
twain
of
a
singer
having
some
fun
and
actually
using
some
intelligent
and
unique
lyrics
(she
wrote
or
cowrote
6
tracks
on
the
cd)
gretchen
in
my
opinion
is
the
second
best
female
singer
out
there
today
(only
behind
sherrie
austin
(and
if
you
read
any
of
my
reviews
of
sherrie
material
you
know
how
much
i
love
her))
she
does
not
do
celene
diontype
mawish
material
(like
trisha
yearwood)
or
pesedo
country
(like
shania
or
faith
hill)
check
out
her
song
homewrecker
with
lines
like
i'm
a
christian
but
if
you
keep
it
up
i'm
gonna
kick
your
pretty
little
butt
that
reminds
me
of
loretta
lynn's
you
ain't
woman
enough
and
i
actually
prefer
homewrecker
i
would
highly
recommend
going
out
and
getting
this
cd
cause
it
is
simply
the
best
cd
of
2004

quite
a
surprise
december

by
bob
mcgrath
formataudio
cd
i'm
not
sure
what
to
make
of
gretchen
wilson
the
production
on
this
album
smacks
of
commercial
nashville
sheen
but
her
material
seems
critical
of
commercial
nashville
sheen
her
first
single
(redneck
woman)
was
of
course
an
enormous
hit
her
second
single
here
for
the
party
was
a
hit
but
was
sort
of
rightfully
pegged
as
redneck
woman
part
2
just
when
i
started
to
doubt
her
she
released
when
i
think
about
cheating
something
very
different
and
probably
almost
too
traditional
for
country
radio
(it
is
doing
fairly
well
riding
on
the
momentum
of
her
seeminglyovernight
rise
to
stardom)
there
are
then
some
interesting
contradictions
at
work
here
and
i
think
that
might
be
the
point
anyone
who
argues
that
wilson
is
the
real
deal
is
clearly
neglecting
the
role
of
savvy
marketing
and
anyone
who
argues
that
she
is
only
a
marketing
creation
is
neglecting
wilson's
obvious
talent
gretchen
wilson
is
just
what
country
needs
female
country
artists
who
rock
are
typically
seen
as
commercial
outcasts
as
are
most
(or
all)
female
country
traditionalists
and
wilson
marries
both
of
these
noncommercial
groups
and
somehow
makes
the
result
commercial
if
she
does
not
possess
the
legitimate
fire
of
a
tanya
tucker
and
if
she
is
not
as
downhome
as
loretta
lynn
at
the
very
least
she
brings
elements
of
these
styles
into
the
mainstream
thus
bringing
attention
to
neglected
artists
who
recently
haven't
been
able
to
break
through
the
sterility
of
nashville
if
nothing
else
gretchen
wilson
is
a
welcome
and
muchneeded
departure
from
the
country
diva
slump
we
have
seen
during
the
last
several
years
so
yes
she's
a
commercialized
version
of
authenticity
and
perhaps
not
quite
the
glorified
redneck
woman
that
she
professes
to
be
but
her
material
must
be
commercial
in
order
to
be
heard
don't
fault
her
for
being
mainstream
instead
appreciate
the
new
elements
she
brings
to
the
mainstream
and
the
manner
in
which
they
might
change
country
radio
for
the
better
