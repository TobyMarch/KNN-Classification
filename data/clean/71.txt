that

six
songs
completed[23]
he
went
on
to
call
the

weird
spectacular
and
creepy
saying
that
it
contained
lots
of
blood[23]
he
noted
that
the

had
a

that
lasted

that
he
would
have
never
imagined
doing
in

the

promised
the

have
slower
songs
there
would
be
some

about
it
it's
really
got

the

more

sort
of
thing
that
has
been
happening
for

that
the

said
narrow

is
a
great
album
one
that
could
make
them
very
famous
but
could
very
well
also
kill
their
careers
and
although
death
cab
for

had
gone
insane
he
believed
the
lp
could
be
an
early
contender
for
the
best
album
of

was
nominated
for

what
they
view
as
the
excessive
use
of
autotune
in

of
emotional
danger[18]
the
band's
music
on
plans
was
described
by
the
dallas
morning
news
as
a
literate
whispery
style
the
kind
of
stuff
that
normally
sounds
better
in
headphones
than
in
large
venues[54]
in
an
interview
with
shave
magazine
ben
gibbard
commented
on
his
song
writing
saying
that
he
never
sit[s]
down
to
write
an
album
number
one
i
just
kind
of
sit
down
and
write
songs
and
the
theme
kind
of
makes
itself
apparent
but
i
would
never
say
i
was
writing
about
searching
for
something
as
much
as
just
trying
to
document
with
every
song
where
i
am
in
that
moment
when
i’m
writing
that
song
if
a
theme
kind
of
makes
itself
apparent
in
a
record
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
fact
that
just
what’s
been
on
my
mind
recently
so
i
guess
clearly
i
have
been
and
was
and
am
but
it
was
never
a
conscious
decision[36]
band
name
[edit]
gibbard
took
the
band
name
from
the
title
of
the
song
written
by
neil
innes
and
vivian
stanshall
and
performed
by
their
group
the
bonzo
dog
doodah
band
in
the
beatles's
1967
film
magical
mystery
tour
the
song's
name
was
in
turn
taken
from
an
invented
pulp
fiction
crime
magazine
the
uses
of
literacy
devised
by
richard
hoggart
as
part
of
his
1957
study
of
working
class
culture
in
a
2011
interview
gibbard
stated
the
name
was
never
supposed
to
be
something
that
someone
was
going
to
reference
15
years
on
so
yeah
i
would
absolutely
go
back
and
give
it
a
more
obvious
name[55]
