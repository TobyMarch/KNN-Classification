biography
wry
thoughtful
singer/songwriter
cary
brothers
broke
into
the
mainstream
with
the
single
blue
eyes
a
gorgeously
articulate
ballad
he
contributed
to
2004's
grammywinning
hipartistshowcasing
garden
state
soundtrack
born
in
1974
to
a
watercolorist
mother
and
surgeon
father
brothers
eschewed
the
sounds
of
his
native
nashville
in
favor
of
britpop
artists
like
the
cure
and
the
smiths
brothers
attended
college
at
northwestern
university
in
the
early
'90s
where
he
met
zach
braff
the
writer
director
and
star
of
garden
state
both
moved
to
la
after
graduation
where
braff
rounded
out
his
acting
r&eacutesum&eacute
and
brothers
partnered
with
a
friend
to
open
a
small
production
company
that
produced
among
other
things
the
freddie
prinze
jr
movie
sparkler
by
2002
though
his
instinct
to
make
music
had
overtaken
his
drive
to
rub
shoulders
with
hollywood
insiders
brothers
who
by
then
had
developed
an
appreciation
for
the
countryfolk
music
he
couldn't
be
bothered
with
as
a
youngster
in
nashville
began
playing
around
la
at
such
venues
as
the
hotel
cafe
a
local
haunt
for
upcoming
singer/songwriters
there
he
honed
the
early
material
that
would
win
over
more
than
10000
buyers
for
his
reverbringed
spring
2005
ep
all
the
rage
before
that
disc
came
out
though
brothers
—
with
the
help
of
buddy
braff
—
had
already
taken
his
sound
to
the
small
screen
after
an
appearance
on
scrubs
his
swelling
popularity
by
then
best
evidenced
by
the
ipod
charts
where
blue
eyes
broke
the
top
100
songs
list
and
topped
the
folk
chart
was
also
helped
along
by
his
business
acumen
in
2004
he
hit
upon
an
idea
for
connecting
with
potential
listeners
he
conceived
a
free
downloadable
song
of
the
week
still
available
on
his
website
that
would
allow
fans
of
his
moody
coldplaymeetsu2
sound
to
send
him
feedback
on
what
they
liked
and
what
for
them
could
use
some
retooling
by
fall
2005
when
a
second
ep
waiting
for
your
letter
was
issued
on
his
procrastination
music
label
the
spike
in
visits
to
his
site
had
confirmed
that
the
concept
was
working
armed
with
a
strong
fan
base
brothers
