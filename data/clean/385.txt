band
homecoming
show
jan

the
sailor
circus

two

honored
with
the
allstar

my
friends

next
up?
a
movie
based
on
allman’s
bestselling
memoir
begins
filming
so
yeah
we
had
a
bunch
of
stuff
to
discuss
when
the
singer
songwriter
keyboardist
and
guitarist
best
known
as
the
leader
of
the
allman
brothers
band
and
composer
of
such
classics
as
“midnight
rider”
“melissa”
and
“whipping
post”
called
from
his
home
near
savannah
ga
he
even
talked
about
the
possibility
of
performing
with
current
sarasotan
dickey
betts
it’s
a
sticky
subject
gregg
and
the
rest
of
the
founding
allman
brothers
band
members
fired
betts
in
2000
the
last
time
you
performed
here
at
the
2006
sarasota
blues
fest
it
was
a
really
special
show
how
do
you
feel
about
returning
to
your
old
hometown?
it
will
be
good
to
be
back
in
sarasota
and
see
all
the
great
fans
i
haven’t
played
there
in
a
long
time
and
i’m
happy
to
return
do
you
have
a
favorite
song
you
wrote
while
living
here?
i
wrote
a
lot
of
stuff
around
there
on
anna
maria
island
sitting
on
my
dock
i
wrote
most
of
the
stuff
from
“i’m
no
angel”
(1986)
and
“just
before
the
bullets
fly”
(1988)
when
i
lived
on
bradenton
beach
who
are
you
most
excited
about
hearing
perform
your
songs
at
the
jan
10
tribute
show
in
atlanta?
man
there
are
so
many
people
on
that
show
i
haven’t
seen
in
so
long
especially
jackson
(browne)
we
used
to
be
roommates
not
really
but
we
hung
together
so
much
we
might’ve
been
roommates
this
was
way
before
either
of
us
were
known
we
were
broke
as
we
could
be
but
i’m
excited
about
everybody
taj
mahal
keb’
mo’
all
of
them
natalie
cole
she’s
a
good
friend
of
mine
i
read
you
are
returning
to
the
studio
with
tbone
burnett
(producer
of
allman’s
acclaimed
2011
solo
album
“low
country
blues”
a
collection
of
mostly
old
blues
songs)
what
can
you
tell
me
about
the
material
you
will
be
recording?
it’s
kind
of
a
second
half
of
the
last
one
but
we’ve
postponed
recording
to
may
just
so
much
stuff
going
on
there
will
be
classic
blues
material
and
stuff
i
wrote
by
myself
i
got
to
road
test
them
you’ll
hear
them
in
sarasota
gregg
allman
discography
a
look
at
his
seven
solo
albums
in
recent
years
your
gregg
allman
band
shows
have
included
killer
performances
of
bob
dylan’s
“just
like
a
woman”
wilson
pickett’s
“i
found
a
love”
and
your
guitarist
scott
sharrard’s
rocker
“love
like
kerosene”
any
of
those
songs
appearing
on
the
upcoming
album?
they
just
might
but
you’re
not
going
to
tell
me
because
you
want
it
to
be
a
surprise
rock
legend
gregg
allman
and
the
allman
brothers
band
performing
in
2011
at
the
orpheum
theatre
in
boston
(aynsley
floyd/ap
images
for
tuneintohepccom)
that’s
a
fact
wouldn’t
be
a
surprise
do
you
plan
on
being
on
set
when
“midnight
rider
the
gregg
allman
story”
starts
shooting
later
this
month?
i’ll
be
in
and
out
i’m
on
tour
in
january
until
the
20th
but
then
i
should
be
there
as
an
executive
producer
of
the
movie
what’s
the
most
important
thing
you
want
to
see
the
director
and
actors
get
right?
(laughs)
the
facts
any
in
particular?
no
just
all
of
them
this
is
all
very
new
to
me
i
can’t
say
much
about
the
film
i’m
still
in
a
crash
course
learning
about
all
this
at
the
funeral
for
dan
toler
(guitarist
in
the
allman
brothers
band
and
gregg
allman
band)
there
were
all
these
beautiful
photos
being
projected
of
you
with
him
and
his
brother
frankie
toler
(drummer
in
the
allman
brothers
band
and
gregg
allman
band)
you
made
some
great
music
with
those
guys
while
living
down
here
how
would
you
like
people
to
remember
the
toler
brothers?
wonderful
people
and
very
talented
and
i
miss
them
so
dickey
betts
recently
sat
in
with
derek
trucks
(current
allman
brothers
band
guitarist)
and
susan
tedeschi’s
band
what
would
you
say
if
dickey
called
you
up
and
asked
to
sit
in
with
you
at
your
show
in
sarasota?
i
would
tell
him
it
would
be
fine
rumor
has
it
your
old
pal
neil
larsen
(keyboardist
who
recently
toured
and
recorded
with
leonard
cohen)
is
going
to
be
in
sarasota
at
the
same
time
as
your
show
is
there
any
chance
of
him
sitting
in
with
you?
i’m
sure
there
is
if
he’s
there
we’ve
been
waiting
a
decade
now
when
might
we
expect
a
new
allman
brothers
band
studio
album?
not
yet
one
of
my
favorite
duane
allman
performances
is
the
allman
brothers
band’s
show
at
the
warehouse
in
new
orleans
from
september
of
1971
any
chance
of
that
getting
an
official
release?

i
don’t
know
you
can
only
release
so
much
of
that
old
stuff
even
though
it
was
a
good
performance
you
can’t
just
flood
the
market
with
board
tapes
of
my
brother
we
released
about
as
much
as
we
plan
to
how
about
a
second
live
album
from
the
gregg
allman
band?
it
has
been
a
while
since
the
“gregg
allman
tour”
(1974)
came
out
there
probably
will
be
one
next
year
some
time
i’m
still
building
my
band
it’s
a
sevenpiece
band
and
i’m
shooting
for
11
and
some
horns
when
i
get
it
totally
complete
i’ll
definitely
be
ready
for
a
live
record
there
are
so
amazing
shows
out
there
of
the
gregg
allman
band
ready
for
release
you’re
quite
the
perfectionist
i
really
am
a
perfectionist
another
album
with
burnett
finally
a
second
live
album
what
else
do
you
have
planned
for
your
solo
career?
i
hope
to
cut
a
record
in
muscle
shoals
and
call
it
“all
compositions
by”
and
then
just
my
name
that’s
on
my
dream
list
it
will
be
all
new
songs
and
the
producer
will
be
don
was
we
are
old
friends
and
wanted
to
do
this
for
the
longest
time
do
you
have
the
songs
written?
i
sure
as
hell
hope
