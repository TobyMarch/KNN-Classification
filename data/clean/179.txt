could
hit
upon
a
pleasant
track
of
thought
a
track
indirectly
reflecting
credit
upon
myself
for
those
are
the
pleasantest
thoughts
and
very
frequent
even
in
the
minds
of
modest

(aka
bluesman
seasick

at

during
this
time
modest
mouse
also
recorded
what
would
have
been
their
first
album
sad
sappy
sucker
but
constant
delays
caused
the
album
to
be
shelved
and
forgotten
it
was
not
until
2001
that
it
was
officially
released
before
making
their
way
into
the
pop
music
world
in
2004
many
of
their
tours
included
stops
at
diy/punk
venues
after
moving
to
up
records[3]
modest
mouse
released
two
fulllength
albums
and
other
recordings
recorded
at

about
this
album

(at
the
time
wold

offering
was
interstate

produced
by
wold
the
1997
album
the
lonesome
crowded
west
(also
recorded
at
moon
studios
by
scott
swayze)
turned
out
to
serve
as
the
band's
breakthrough
the
lonesome
crowded
west
gained
the
band
a
cult
following
and
is
now
popularly
considered
to
be
one
of
the
defining
albums
of
mid1990s
indie
rock
during
this
time
nick
kraft
was
brought
in
to
refine
the
band's
sound

according
to
emails
sent

confused
about

modest

is
indeed
currently
writing

and
have
been
for

some

despite
this
the
email
also
reminds
fans
of
the
fact
that
brock
naming
his
record
label
glacial
pace
was
not
an
accident
thus
it
remains
unclear
when
