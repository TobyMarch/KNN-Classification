he
and
george
strait
criticized
the
state
of
country
music
on
the
song
murder
on
music
row
the
song
sparked
debate
in
the
country
music
community
about
whether
or
not
traditional
country
music
was
actually
dead
or
not[11]
despite
the
fact
that
the
song
was
not
officially
released
as
a
single
it
became
the
highestcharting
nonseasonal

remarking
if
garth
and
shania
have
raised
the
bar
for
country
concerts
with
kissstyle
production
and
endless
costume
changes
then
alan
jackson
is
doing
his
best
to
return
the

to
a
more
human
level[13]
after
the
september
11
2001
attacks
jackson
released
where
were
you
(when
the
world
stopped
turning)
as
a
tribute
to
those
killed
in
the
9/11
terrorist
attacks
the
song
became
a
hit
single
and
briefly
propelled
him
into
the
mainstream
spotlight
at
the
2001
cma
awards
jackson
debuted
the
song
where
were
you
when
the
world
stopped
turning
the
performance
was
generally
considered
the
highlight
of
the
show
and
jackson's
site
crashed
the
next
day
from
server
requests[14]
the
song
came
to
jackson
suddenly
and
had
not
been

performance
began
receiving

music
album
entitled
precious
memories
he
put
together
the
album
by
the
request
of
his
mother
who
enjoys
religious
music
jackson
considered
this
album
a
side
project
and
nothing
too
official
but
it
was
treated
as
such
over
18
million

contemporary/folk
sound
unlike
most
of
jackson's
album
this
one
earned
only
a
gold
record
and
was
criticized
as
out
of
character
by
some
fans
unlike
his
previous
albums
like
red
on
a
rose
had
a
different
producer
and
sound
alan's
main
producer
for
his
music
keith
stegall
was
notably
absent
from
this

krauss

hired
to
produce
the
album
she
also
chose
the
songs
despite
being
labeled
as
country
music
or
bluegrass
like
red
on
a
rose
had
a
mainstream
sound
to
it
upsetting
some
fans
even
making
some
of
them
believe
that
jackson
was
abandoning
his
traditional
past
and
aiming
toward
a
more
mainstream
jazz/blues
sound
