david
the
lion
for
pedro
the
lion's
david
bazan
there
is
no
separating
art
and
faith
the
bornagain
rocker
talks
about
how
his
beliefs
shape
his
music
and
his
life
by
tim
mcmahan
&nbsp
despite
the
nature
of
his
music
and
his
own
personal
beliefs
pedro
the
lion's
david
bazan
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
he
isn't
out
to
convert
anyone
he's
no
christian
rocker
but
he
does
have
a
message
and
he
wants
you
to
listen
bazan
had
agreed
to
do
an
interview
at
the
soundcheck
for
his
july
6
show
at
the
sokol
underground
that
also
featured
velour
100
and
saddle
creek
records
bands
cursive
and
bright
eyes
i
showed
up
at
the
venue
at
around
7
pm
and
sure
enough
there
he
was
reclined
in
the
payload
area
of
a
shiny
white
tour
van
that
more
closely
resembled
a
soccermom's
suv
than
a
rockandroll
caravan
bazan
looked
different
than
the
photos
i'd
seen
online
which
pictured
a
thin
amishlooking
fellow
with
a
beard
and
wellgroomed
haircut
not
today
bazan
was
cleanshaven
with
a
buzzcut
that
bordered
on
skinhead
he
also
looked
chunkier
sort
of
football
playerbuff
in
his
black
tshirt
and
shorts
what's
funny
about
pedro
the
lion
is
that
almost
no
one
seemed
to
know
that
their
music
is
predominately
christian
in
nature
including
me
i
had
even
carefully
reviewed
the
cd
a
few
months
earlier
and
somehow
the
spiritualness
of
it
all
just
seemed
to
slip
right
past
me
i
discovered
my
gaff
after
reading
a
couple
interviews
on
the
'net
where
bazan
talked
about
his
faith
his
music
and
his
loathing
for
christian
rock
does
he
mind
talking
about
religion
during
rock
interviews?
i'm
torn
about
it
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
i
wouldn't
want
to
discuss
it
in
this
venue
he
said
across
a
table
that
would
later
be
covered
with
band
merchandise
set
up
in
the
back
of
the
cavernous
sokol
underground
no
one
had
arrived
except
a
bartender
and
marc
leibowitz
the
show's
promoter
(who
also
wasn't
aware
of
the
band's
religious
nature)
bandmates
trey
many
bass
and
josh
golden
drums
were
off
trying
to
find
a
music
store
to
buy
a
replacement
tube
for
a
blown
guitar

&nbsp
photos
taken
at
the
july
6
2000
pedro
show
at
omaha's
sokol
underground
&nbsp
regardless
of
his
apprehension
just
about
everything
we
talked
about
in
the
hour
or
so
before
velour
100
took
the
stage
(bazan
plays
keyboards
for
that
band
too)
in
some
way
centered
around
religion
or
faith
the
son
of
a
music
pastor
for
the
assemblies
of
god
church
bazan
said
that
his
faith
naturally
permeates
his
music
because
it
is
an
extension
of
who
he
is
anyone
with
a
strong
sincere
belief
in
something
shouldn't
treat
it
lightly
he
said
quietly
it
seems
i'm
always
being
called
upon
to
boil
down
my
faith
for
interviews
defining
it
should
be
done
with
great
care
it
is
the
cavalier
attitude
reflected
by
christian
rockers

who
make
a
living
finding
ways
to
make
holy
scripture
fit
alongside
gnarly
power
chords

that
drives
bazan's
hatred
for
their
genre
in
addition
to
their
music
being
limitlessly
cheesy
bazan
believes
christian
rock
bands
are
wasting
their
time
preaching
from
beneath
a
hot
spotlight
when
the
basic
act
of
being
creative
glorifies
god
that's
where
christian
rock
falls
apart
he
said
it
turns
the
music
and
the
message
into
crap
the
message
is
degraded
when
it's
made
into
slogans
and
lowlevel
propaganda
they're
attempting
to
reach
a
certain
audience
just
like
advertisers
do

and
that
ultimately
degrades
the
art
a
more
pure
model
he
said
would
be
to
try
to
express
yourself
artistically
as
honestly
and
sincerely
as
possible
but
it's
not
as
simple
as
it
sounds
artists
are
constantly
lured
by
the
promise
of
big
money
and
always
seek
approval
from
their
peers
it
would
be
na�ve
to
think
you
could
steer
clear
of
the
forces
of
money
and
acceptance
bazan
said
intensely
to
ignore
it
is
to
let
it
rule
you
you
can
only
control
it
if
you
openly
address
it
bazan
isn't
immune
to
the
temptations
i'm
married
i'd
like
for
my
records
to
sell
well
i
get
a
check
and
that
helps
me
and
my
wife
buy
groceries
and
pay
the
rent
the
economics
of
the
job
are
always
there
along
with
wanting
to
be
recognized
for
your
work
&nbsp
if
the
economics
are
sparse
while
the
band's
on
the
road
(at
one
time
he
and
drummer
golden
argued
over
the
price
of
beer
and
fruit
juice
as
if
they
were
debating
over
how
to
use
the
last
of
the
clean
water
on
a
desert
island)
peer
acceptance
is
in
great
supply
the
band's
recent
cd
winners
never
quit
released
earlier
this
year
on
jade
tree
has
been
lauded
by
critics
and
fans
alike
for
its
power
beauty
and
unconventional
honesty
it's
a
concept
album
of
sorts
a
collection
of
firstperson
accounts
confessions
and
explanations
all
unregretfully
sung
straight
from
the
attacker's
mouth
(most
of
the
lyrics
are
surrounded
by
quotes)
they
are
macabre
portraits
of
murder
and
violence
justified
by
necessity
with
only
a
hint
of
regret
each
deed
told
is
met
with
a
clear
conscience
of
a
man
who
feels
his
motives
are
misunderstood
bazan
makes
the
songs
so
arresting
and
at
times
downright
danceable
that
they're
impossible
to
ignore
his
low
sullen
voice
recalls
mark
kozelek
(red
house
painters)
or
mark
eitzel
(american
music
club)
and
convincingly
adds
the
necessary
pathos
that
compliments
the
strippeddown
arrangements
(bazan
played
all
the
instruments
on
the
recording)
half
the
songs
are
slow
folkish
dirges
the
other
half
are
indieguitardriven
rock
songs
call
them
parables
if
you
will
the
first
song
on
the
cd
slow
and
steady
wins
the
race
directly
addresses
faith
and
its
rewards
as
the
narrator
sings
about
his
devotion
to
all
that
is
good
while
his
brother
takes
a
darker
path
through
life
thanks
to
his
good
deeds
he
believes
that
he'll
be
greeted
warmly
in
heaven
with
the
rest
of
the
deserved
few
the
guy
who
stays
on
the
straight
and
narrow
represents
the
typical
christian
viewpoint
bazan
said
do
what's
right
at
all
costs
it
produces
people
who
think
they're
righteous
and
are
going
to
heaven
and
the
bible's
very
clear
that
no
one
is
good
or
can
earn
their
way
because
our
hearts
are
dark
the
only
hope
we
have
is
in
the
record
and
performance
of
a
different
person
who's
willing
to
let
us
take
it
all
on
ourselves
&nbsp
that
person
he
says
matteroffactly
is
jesus
if
it
sounds
like
the
interview
was
getting
pretty
heavy
you're
right
but
bazan
doesn't
come
off
as
someone
who's
trying
to
guide
you
on
the
right
path
(remember
i
asked
the
questions)
he
was
merely
explaining
the
songs
on
his
cd
most
of
which
happen
to
rock
like
an
old
jawbreaker
album
despite
the
solemn
lyrics
there
is
no
praise
jesus
sloganeering
to
be
found
instead
a
mind
of
her
own
is
a
husband
arguing
with
his
wife
beginning
with
dear
unlock
the
door
and
ending
with
you
put
down
that
telephone/you're
not
calling
anyone
sung
over
shimmering
pounding
guitar
never
leave
a
job
half
done
opens
just
after
the
narrator
has
killed
his
wife
or
lover
justifying
his
crime
with
she
almost
ruined
everything
grim
but
thoroughly
danceable
eye
on
the
finish
line
is
another
murder
tale
of
a
criminal
with
a
clear
conscience
who
fears
his
motives
will
be
misconstrued
even
by
the
victim
given
the
time
i
think
she
would
have
understood/that
it
was
for
the
greater
good
bazan
shows
us
the
darkest
side
of
human
nature
and
hopes
we
walk
away
with
a
lesson
if
you
think
you're
good
and
you're
proud
of
it
you
will
be
very
very
sorry
one
day
he
said
if
you're
a
total
mess
and
you're
sorry
and
you
don't
know
what
to
do
about
it
then
there's
hope
this
record
is
a
complete
connected
narrative
from
the
first
to
last
song
there
was
a
theme
i
wanted
to
communicate
damnation
for
the
arrogant
judgment
for
the
judgmental
somehow
he's
managed
to
express
this
warning
without
sounding
like
robert
duvall
in
the
apostle
or
even
someone
whose
life
is
centered
on
his
faith
he
beliefs
are
far
from
conventional
however
bazan
is
outraged
by
how
politics
have
influenced
religion
especially
where
moral
issues
are
concerned
&nbsp
there
was
a
theme
i
wanted
to
communicate
damnation
for
the
arrogant
judgment
for
the
judgmental
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
if
he's
real
and
is
a
real
force
in
my
heart
or
life
i
don't
have
to
be
closed
to
anything
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
take
abortion
for
instance
i
think
it's
totally
tragic
and
wrong
but
people
need
to
be
convinced
of
that
themselves
legislation
convinces
no
one
the
more
freedom
we
have
as
individuals
the
better
it
is
for
our
culture
the
more
freedom
the
better
everyone
is
so
closed
to
everything
he
said
of
a
majority
of
conservative
followers
of
organized
christianity
if
he's
real
and
is
a
real
force
in
my
heart
or
life
i
don't
have
to
be
closed
to
anything
i
would
be
the
first
in
line
to
watch
the
last
temptation
of
christ
it
was
an
utterly
boring
movie
but
it
wasn't
offensive
if
he's
god
why
would
he
care
about
a
movie?
it's
absurd
but
that's
the
way
a
lot
of
christians
think
they
try
to
close
themselves
off
to
experience
if
they're
that
easily
contaminated
than
he
isn't
real
to
them
anyway
he's
removed
and
aloof
if
he
were
real
to
you
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
the
discussion
didn't
stop
there
bazan
went
on
to
talk
about
popular
culture
vs
art
(the
brainvacation
pleasure
of
a
confectionery
movie
like
mission
impossible
2
vs
an
eloquent
moving
portrait
of
human
nature
like
magnolia)
big
money
vs
integrity
(money
can't
buy
happiness
and
being
with
a
major
label
ultimately
would
mean
living
with
the
fact
that
you're
a
whore

it's
a
tradeoff
he
said)
and
living
a
corporate
life
vs
taking
a
risk
on
doing
what
you
really
want
to
do
in
life
(i
quit
my
dayjob
to
do
this
and
it
panned
out
for
others
who've
taken
the
risk
it
hasn't
it's
about
courage
and
luck)
but
bazan's
convinced
that
his
rockandroll
live
won't
last
forever
at
the
tender
age
of
24
he
said
he
believes
in
five
years
he'll
be
making
a
living
doing
something
else
i'll
have
a
job
that's
not
pedro
the
lion
he
said
my
wife
(annkrestene)
and
i
agreed
that
i
need
to
do
this
until
i
can't
do
it
anymore
the
day
will
come
when
the
money
dries
up
and
this
will
take
a
back
seat
to
providing
for
my
family
it's
inevitable
besides
financial
pressures
is
he
getting
tired
of
being
in
a
band
and
writing
music?
the
human
condition
is
so
complicated
i
can't
imagine
not
being
inspired
he
said
art
could
not
exist
in
a
vacuum
artists
are
inspired
by
all
that's
around
them
politics
are
dead
with
the
advent
of
big
corporations
all
the
real
heavyduty
moral
issues
don't
matter
as
much
as
the
fabric
of
our
lives
as
things
get
worse

as
teenagers
kill
each
other
in
high
schools
the
divorce
rate
skyrockets
and
the
number
of
disenfranchised
grows

inevitably
there's
more
for
the
artists
to
write
about
and
there
are
some
good
things
happening
as
well

added
smiling
with
that
trey

to
the
stage

finally
