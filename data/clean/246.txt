10
track

of
songs
originally
released

hadn't
even

yet
that
having
been
said
let's
focus
on
the
material
that
is
included
here
track
1
dream
on
is
really
the
only
true
worthy
track
from
the
aerosmith
debut
album
this
is
a
classic
that
was
rereleased
as
a
single
in
1976
after
the
success
of
toys
in
the
attic
fm

stations

track
2
same
old
song
and
dance
is
the
only
track
from
the
get
your
wings
album
while
this
is
a
great
song
train
kept'
a
rollin'
would
have
been
a
better
choice
if
they
were
only
going
to
pick
one
for
this
album
track
3
sweet
emotion
from
the
toys
in
the
attic
album
has
been
butchered
here
the
track
starts
out
already
in
progress
it's
like
switching
the
radio
dial
and
finding
an
aerosmith
song
that
had
already
started
before
you
switched
the
dial
this
track
clocks
in
at
312
whereas
the
toys
in
the
attic
version
clocks
in
at
434
track
4
walk
this
way
also
from
the
toys
in
the
attic
album
is
essential
on
any
aerosmith
greatest
hits
collection
but
just
like
sweet
emotion
it
has
been
cut
from
it's
original
340
to
312
track
5
last
child
from
the
rocks
album
is
essential
and
is
intact
track
6
back
in
the
saddle
also
from
the
rocks
album
is
essential
and
is
intact
track
7
draw
the
line
from
the
draw
the
line
album
is
one
of
two
essential
tracks
from
that
album
track
8
kings
and
queens
also
from
the
draw
the
line
album
is
the
other
essential
track
like
sweet
emotion
they've
butchered
it
badly
here

starting
already
in
progress
and
cut
way
short
disappointing!
track
9
come
together
is
essential
from
the
band's
participation
in
the
seargeant
pepper's
lonely
hearts
club
band
movie
soundtrack
this
was
a
very
popular
single
that
aerosmith
released
in
1978
track
10
remember
(walking
in
the
sand)
from
the
night
in
the
ruts
album
was
a
popular
single
in
1979
all
in
all
aerosmith's
greatest
hits
is
a
very
good
representation
of
aerosmith's
work
in
the
70's
my
biggest
complaint
is
about
the
butchering
of
sweet
emotion
walk
this
way
and
kings
and
queens
start
with
toys
in
the
attic
and
rocks
and
then
build
your
collection
from
there
it'll
cost
more
than
the
aerosmith's
greatest
hits
cd
but
it'll
be

cd
you
gotta
look
at
this
cd
as
more
of
a
primer
to
test
the
waters
to
see
if
you
want
more
early
aerosmith
cd's
than
as
the
endall
cd
to
replace
all
their
other
70's
albums
it
only
has
ten
songs
true
but
bear
in
mind
this
is
a
1980
release
10
songs
was
pretty
much
the
industry
standard
for
any
album
back
then
it
contains
severely
edited
versions
of
several
songs
the
most
horrible
example
being
sweet
emotion
which
deletes
the
cool
talkbox
guitar
intro
and
the
coda
section
where
it
really
kicks
back
in
(this
version
just
fades
out)
once
again
like
it
or
not
this
is
typical
of
greatest
hits
albums
(hey
the
hit
radio
versions
of
songs
typically
are
shortened
versions
of
what
you
get
on
the
albums)
but
for
those
of
you
only
familiar
with
walk
this
way
sweet
emotion
and
dream
on
from
their
70's
heyday
you'll
find
some
nice
surprises
here
back
in
the
saddle
with
its
galloping
rhythm
and
cool
12string
bass
lines
is
one
of
the
best
things
they've
ever
done
and
last
child
is
a
catchy
funky
number
featuring
some
great
steven
tyler
yelps
at
the
end
same
old
song
and
dance
is
another
riffdriven
rocker
with
horns
(aerosmith
had
to
be
one
of
the
pioneers
of
combining
hard
rock
with
horns)
draw
the
line
is
a
good
noiserocker
that
features
a
great
slide
guitar
riff
people
have
griped
about
the
inclusion
of
come
together
here
but
keep
it
mind
it's
not
available
on
any
other
aerosmith
albums
other
than
the
pricey
pandora's
box
(and
it
was
a
top
40
hit

therefore
a
greatest
hit)
kings

queens
and
remember
(walking
in
the
sand)
don't
do
much
for
me
but
they
at
least
show
a
softer
side
of
the
band
leaning
more
towards
art
rock
and
60's
rb
respectively
get
this
let
it
grow
on
you
then
pick
up
toys
in
the
attic
and
rocks
and
then
rock!

cd
i
have
no
problem
with
greatest
hits
packages
but
when
they
butcher
the
songs
with
45
editing
you
get
halfass
versions
of
songs
that
were
meant
to
be
heard
in
their
entirety
add
to
this
poor
decision
that
they
included
two
songs
that
need
not
be
here
kings
and
queens
and
the
ridiculous
remember
(walking
in
the
sand)
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
others
songs
that
deserve
to
be
included
here
all
that
aside
if
you
really
want
to
introduce
yourself
to
this
band
buy
toys
in
the
attic
or
rocks
or
one
of
the
other
scads
of
hits
packages
they've
greedily
dumped
on
the
consumer
over
the
years
save
your
money

august

2001
by
a
customer
formataudio
cd
yes
it
packs
a
punch

but
a
very
short
punch
aerosmith
had
so
many
great
songs
and
radio
staples
in
this
era
collecting
a
mere
ten
of
them
for
a
'greatest
hits'
compilation
just
doesn't
do
the
band
justice
and
a
few
selections
simply
don't
belong
come
together
was
a
nice
sleazy
cover
of
the
beatles'
classic
but
not
one
of
the
band's
better
recordings
and
(remember)
walking
in
the
sand
is
just
plain
weak
kings
and
queens
is
a
good

though
not
particularly
great

song
that
loses
some
of
it's
charm
in
this
edited
version
of
course
there
are
some
downright
essential
70s
hard
rock
tunes
here
such
as
dream
on
walk
this
way
sweet
emotion
last
child

back
in
the
saddle
but
the
fact
that
other
wellknown
gems
like
mama
kin
train'
kept
a
rollin'
and
toys
in
the
attic
are
left
off
is
particularly
disappointing
given
the
inclusion
of
lesser
songs
and
the
extremely
short
running
time
for
aerosmith
an
album
band
that
produced
so
many
great
tunes
a
'best
of'
compilation
should
have
at
least
more
than
thirty
minutes
of
stellar
material
'greatest
hits'
is
a
disappointment
and
casual
fans
looking
for
a
decent
overview
of
the
band's
early
career
should
not
purchase
it
without
also
picking
up
gems
a
collection
of
more
great
vintage
aerosmith
for
an
even
better
experience
you
may
want
to
delve
into
the
actual
albums
('toys
in
the
attic'
and
'rocks'
are
outstanding
and
their
others
are
quite
solid
as
well)
