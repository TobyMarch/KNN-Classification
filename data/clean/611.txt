if
you
prefer
to
get
to
your
music
with
a
click
rather
than
flipping
through
pages
of
discs
in
your
cd
case
then
you
have
plenty
of
options
to
choose
from
music
streaming
services
are
all
the
rage
these
days
and
spotify
is
the
top
dog
when
it
comes
to
music
on
demand
with
a
massive
–
and
very
connected
–
24
million
active
users
streaming
their
music
through
spotify
any
challenger
finds
itself
looking
up
a
steep
hill
to
climb
when
it
comes
to
catching
up
beats
music
thinks
it’s
capable
of
building
its
service
big
enough
to
cast
a
shadow
on
spotify
and
it’s
putting
a
massive
marketing
budget
behind
that
goal
as
ac/dc
says
it’s
a
long
way
to
the
top
which
of
these
services
can
make
the
trip?
music
catalog
there
are
a
lot
of
similarities
between
spotify
and
beats
music
in
fact
we’re
willing
to
bet
there’s
probably
somewhere
near
20
million
of
them
that
is
how
many
songs
both
spotify
and
beats
music
both
boast
how
much
crossover
there
is
between
these
is
hard
to
say
and
even
if
you
start
listening
now
and
don’t
stop
for
the
next
100
years
odds
are
good
you
won’t
find
a
song
on
one
service
that
you
can’t
find
on
the
other
in
fact
in
its
five
years
of
existence
20
percent
of
spotify’s
library
has
never
even
been
listened
to
by
anyone
distinguishing
a
winner
between
two
services
with
more
music
than
you’ll
ever
need
is
nearly
impossible
beats
music
playlists
winner
tie
social
connectivity
spotify
has
it’s
deep
entrenchment
into
facebook
to
thank
for
some
of
its
success
having
songs
played
on
spotify
pop
up
in
news
feeds
on
one
of
the
world’s
most
visited
websites
is
about
as
good
of
publicity
as
you
can
get
it’s
also
a
total
turnoff
for
those
who
aren’t
into
facebook
no
matter
how
sure
you
are
that
you
friends
love
your
taste
in
music
not
everyone
wants
to
see
what
song
you’re
listening
to
at
all
times
spotify
doesn’t
require
facebook
but
it’s
used
as
a
strong
incentive
though
recent
features
have
promoted
spotify’s
own
internal
social
network
beats
music
uses
social
networks
during
its
sign
up
process
but
it’s
in
no
way
required
it’s
easy
enough
to
just
sign
up
with
an
email
address
there
is
the
ability
to
share
your
tunes
via
facebook
and
twitter
but
it’s
a
more
active
decision
requiring
you
to
share
it
like
you
would
a
link
beats
music
is
more
interested
in
getting
you
intertwined
in
its
own
network
of
influencers
and
curators
than
it
is
turning
you
into
one
for
your
friends
if
you’re
into
sharing
and
social
networking
spotify
is
the
clear
answer
for
you
but
if
you
tend
to
avoid
updating
your
statuses
and
following
your
friends
beats
music
is
a
better
bet
winner
spotify
music
discovery
with
the
amount
of
content
on
spotify
and
beats
music
essentially
the
same
they
take
two
very
different
approaches
to
helping
you
find
new
music
spotify
essentially
puts
its
discovery
options
on
the
back
of
your
friends
if
the
people
you
are
connected
with
have
good
taste
and
listen
to
a
ton
of
music
you’re
going
to
have
a
lot
more
to
work
with
when
it
comes
to
spotify
you
can
subscribe
to
playlists
created
by
people
and
enjoy
the
music
they
put
together
other
than
that
there’s
some
bare
bones
stuff
that
spotify
puts
together
in
its
home
page
and
some
really
basic
artist
suggestions
that
aren’t
all
that
personal
and
often
flat
out
wrong
however
the
newer
discover
tab
does
surface
some
unique
tracks
and
albums
by
seeing
what
other
people
like
you
are
listening
to
and
some
song
analysis
you
can
stream
songs
on
demand
with
beats
music
but
it’s
way
more
interested
in
bringing
you
new
stuff
when
you
sign
up
for
the
service
it
asks
you
to
indicate
your
favorite
genres
and
artists
this
serves
to
bring
you
the
content
on
your
homepage
which
is
updated
regularly
with
playlists
and
albums
of
artists
you
should
enjoy
you
can
create
a
mix
made
specifically
for
a
moment
with
the
sentence
which
asks
you
to
fill
in
the
blanks
on
a
sentence
to
tell
your
situation
and
help
beats
music
set
the
mood
for
you
there’s
also
content
curated
by
people
and
sortable
genre
activity
and
playlist
creator
basically
any
way
you
can
imagine
to
find
new
music
is
covered
under
the
beats
music
umbrella
sadly
neither
of
these
services
have
likely
cracked
the
code
of
music
discovery
yet
no
service
has
winner
no
one
comparing
the
free
versions
this
is
an
easy
one
spotify
allows
you
to
stream
unlimited
music
for
free
from
your
desktop
albeit
with
ads
occasionally
interrupting
you
beats
music
has
no
free
version
to
speak
of
spotify
has
a
30
day
free
trial
available
to
its
premium
service
beats
music
only
gives
you
7
days
(unless
you’re
an
att
customer
in
which
case
you
get
a
full
30
day
trial)
if
you’re
short
on
cash
or
don’t
want
to
commit
to
a
monthly
subscription
you
can’t
consider
beats
music
winner
spotify
comparing
the
paid
versions
if
you’re
willing
to
fork
over
some
hard
earned
cash
each
month
to
get
your
fix
of
streaming
music
your
decision
is
going
to
come
down
to
features
because
almost
everything
else
about
the
paid
spotify
and
beats
music
services
are
the
same
for
$10
a
month
–
both
services
charge
the
same
fee
–
you
have
access
to
essentially
the
same
amount
of
music
both
spotify
and
beats
music
allow
you
to
stream
to
your
heart’s
content
as
a
single
user
on
up
to
three
devices
with
streaming
occurring
on
only
one
device
at
a
time
spotify
does
offer

beats
music
does
allow
users
to
download

them

which
spotify
offers
as
well
both
paid
services
emphasize
top
quality
streaming
sound
offering
all
available
tracks
in
320kbps
quality
it’s
worth
noting
that
beats
music
does
have
a
second
paid
option
the
family
plan
it’s
available
exclusively
to
att
customers
with
a
data
plan
through
the
carrier
for
$15
a
month
a
family
of
up
to
5
people
can
stream
music
freely
through
beats
music
on
up
to
10
devices
for
$5
more
a
month
you’ll
be
able
to
spread
the
love
this
might
be
a
killer
feature
for
those
who
listen
to
music
across
a
myriad
of
devices
or
have
a
musicobsessed
family
which
makes
the
att
exclusivity
such
a
shame
winner

(for

where
can
you
use
it?
since
taking
music
with
you
is
key
when
it
comes
to
streaming
music
the
availability
of
a
service
is

you
should
not
have
a

finding

to
