to
be
the

he
quickly
learned
the
drums
(despite
having

previous
experience)[3]
the
band
finally
settled
on
the
name
coldplay
which
was
suggested
by
tim
crompton
a
local
student
who
had
been
using
the
name
for
his
group[6]
by
1997
martin
had
also
met
then
classics

tim
riceoxley
during
a
weekend
on
virginia
water
in
surrey
they
asked
each
other
to
play
off
their
own
songs
on
the
piano
martin
finding
riceoxley
to
be
talented
asked
him
to
be
coldplay's
keyboard
player
but
riceoxley
refused
as
his
own
band
keane
was
already
active
days
after
this
event
would
shape
the

later
pleaded
with
him
to
return
after
kicking
him
out
and
because

his
guilt
went
on
a
drinking
binge
eventually
the

worked
out
their
differences

put
in
place
a
new
set
of
rules
to
keep
the
group
intact
inspired
by
bands
like

music
as
limestone
rock
in

the

has
been
called
meditative

it
[reflects]

endlessly
examine[s]
his

the
eps
released
by
the

had
characteristics
of
dream
pop
setting
them
apart
from
later
studio
albums
the
tone
of
the
band's
first
studio
album
parachutes
was
described
as
melodic
pop
with
distorted
guitar
riffs
and
swishing
percussion
but
also
being
exquisitely
dark
and
artistically
abrasive[141]
such
alternative
rock
style
has
been
compared
to
bands
like

oasis
radiohead
and
travis[141][142]
the

the

the
songs
in

were
considered
to
contain
lush
melodies
and
a
heartbreak
and
that
they
had
a
newfound
confidence[146]
the
music
on
their
third
release
xy
has
been
considered
to
be
ruminations
on
martin's
doubts
fears
hopes
and
loves[140]
it
was
particularly
influenced
by
the
artists
johnny
cash
and
kraftwerk[147]
in
viva

all
his

the
group's
style
was
moving

being
influenced
by
the
bands
blur
arcade
fire
and
my
bloody

electronic
and
acoustic
elements
lyrical
influences
were
taken
from
graffiti
and
the
german
resistance
group
white
rose[151]
regarding
their
international
wide
success
the
band's
president
at
parlophone
miles
leonard
has
stated
that
one
of
their
secrets
is
that
they
have
never
sounded
like
a
parochial
uk
artist
saying
some
bands
are
very
proud
to
be
british
but
sometimes
come
across
as
being
very
‘british’
coldplay
never
aspire
to
that
on
one
hand
they
sound
british
but
on
the
other
they
sound
like
a
huge
global
artist[112]
in
2011
coldplay
were
hailed
as
'rock
statesmen'[152]
activism
and

abbreviated
as
mtf
shown
on
chris
martin's
piano
during
a
concert
despite
their
worldwide
popularity
the
band
has
remained
protective
of
how
their
music
is
used
in
the
media
refusing
its
use
for
product
endorsements
in
the
past
coldplay
turned
down
multimillion
dollar
contracts
from
gatorade
diet
coke
and
gap
who
wanted
to
use
the
songs
yellow
trouble
and
don't
panic
respectively[153]
according
to
frontman
chris
martin
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
live
with
ourselves
if
we
sold
the
songs'
meanings
like
that[153]
the
song
viva
la
vida
was
featured
in
a
commercial
for
the
itunes
store
advertising
its
exclusive
availability
of
the
single
as
a
digital
download
on
itunes[154]
additionally
chris
martin
appeared
at
an
apple
inc
special
event
on
1
september
2010
playing
a
number
of
songs
and
also
thanked
apple
for
their
assistance
in
marketing
viva

after
the
death
of
steve
jobs
coldplay
performed
four
songs
at
apple's
campus
in
cupertino
further
thanking

for
the
support
he
gave
them[156]
coldplay
supports
amnesty
international
and
performed
for
them
at
the
secret
policeman's
ball
fundraiser
in
2012[157]
martin
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
visible
celebrity
advocates
for
fair
trade
supporting
oxfam's
ongoing
make
trade
fair
campaign[158]
he
has
been
on
trips
with
oxfam
to
assess
conditions
has
appeared
in
its
advertising
campaign
and
is
known
for
wearing
a
make
trade
fair
wristband
during
public
appearances
(including
at
coldplay
concerts)[159]
the
band
were
also
filmed
for
make
poverty
history
clicking
their
fingers[160]
during
the
early
years
coldplay
became
widely
known
in
the
media
for
giving
10
percent
of
the
band's
profits
to
charity[161]
which
they
continue
to
do[162]
bassist
guy
berryman
said
you
can
make
people
aware
of
issues
it
isn't
very
much
effort
for
us
at
all
but
if
it
can
help
people
then
we
want
to
do
it[157]
the
band
also
asks
that
any
gifts
intended
for
them
are
donated
to
charity
according
to
a
response
on
the
faq
section
of
coldplay's
website
martin
spoke
out
against
the
2003
invasion
of
iraq
by
the
us
uk
and
other
forces
and
endorsed
the
us
democratic
presidential
candidates
john
kerry[163]
and
barack
obama
in
2004
and
2008
respectively[164]
in

began
supporting

change
by
