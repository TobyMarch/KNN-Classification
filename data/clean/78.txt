highlight
of

the

songs

the
supporting

tensions
within
the

the
point
where
alan

quit

height
of

gore's
alcoholism

fletcher

later
recall
why
am
i
in
the
band?
it
was
accidental
right
from
the
beginning
i
was
actually
forced
to
be
in
the
band
i
played
the
guitar
and
i
had
a
bass
it
was
a
question
of
them
roping
me
in[6]
in
1979
clarke
played
guitar
in
an
ultravox
ripoff
band

formed
a
band
called
composition
of
sound
with
clarke
on
vocals/guitar
gore
on
keyboards
and
fletcher
on
bass
soon
after
the
formation
of
composition
of
sound
clarke
heard
electricity
the
debut
single
by
wirral
electronic
duo
orchestral
manoeuvres
in
the
dark
(omd)
he
said
of
the
song
it
sounded
so
different
from
anything
i'd
heard
that
really
made
me
want
to
make
electronic
music
'cause
it
was
so
unique[9]
along
with
omd
other
early
influences
included
the
human
league
daniel
miller
and
fad
gadget[10]
clarke
and
fletcher
switched
to
synthesisers
working
odd
jobs
in
order
to
buy
or
borrow
the
instruments
from
friends
dave
gahan
joined
the
band
in
1980
after
clarke
heard
him
perform
at
a
local
scout
hut
jam
session
singing
a
rendition
of
david
bowie's
heroes[11]
and
depeche
mode
were
born
when
explaining
the
choice
for
the
new
name
taken
from
a
french
fashion
magazine
d&eacutep&ecircche
mode
(from
french
d&eacutep&ecircche
that
means
here
dispatch
(from
old
french
despesche/despeche)
or
news
report
and
mode
that
means
fashion)
gore
said
it
means
hurried
fashion
or
fashion
dispatch
i
like
the
sound
of
that[12]
but
in
french
the
real
and
only
meaning
of
the
magazine's
name
(and
hence
the
band's)
is
fashion
news
or
fashion
update[13]
gore
recollects
that
the
first
time
the
band
played
as
depeche
mode
was
a
school
gig
in
may
1980[14]
the
band
made
their
recording
debut
in
1980
on
the
some
bizzare
album
with
the
song
photographic
which
was
later
rerecorded
for
their
debut
album
speak

spell
the
band
made
a
demo
tape
but
instead
of
mailing
the
tape
to
record
companies
they
would
go
in
and
personally
deliver
it
they
would
demand
the
companies
play
it
according
to
dave
gahan
most
of
them
would
tell
us
to
fuck
off
they'd
say
'leave
the
tape
with
us'
and
we'd
say
'it's
our
only
one'
then
we'd
say
goodbye
and
go
somewhere
else[15]
according
to
gahan
prior
to
securing
their
record
contract
they
were
receiving
offers
from
all
the
major
labels
phonogram
offered
them
money
you
could
never
have
imagined
and
all
sorts
of
crazy
things
like
clothes
allowances[15]
while
playing
a
live
gig
at
the
bridge
house
in
canning
town[16]
the
band
were
approached
by
daniel
miller
an
electronic
musician
and
founder
of
mute
records
who
was
interested
in
their
recording
a
single
for
his
burgeoning
label[17]
the
result
of
this
verbal
contract
was
their
first
single
dreaming
of
me
recorded
in
december
1980
and
released
in
february
1981
it
reached
number
57
in
the
uk
charts
encouraged
by
this
the
band
recorded
their
second
single
new
life
which
climbed
to
number
11
in
the
uk
charts
and
got
them
to
appear
on
top
of
the
pops
the
band
actually
went
to
london
by
train
dragging
their
synthesisers
all
the
way
to
the
bbc's
studios
the
band's
next
single
was
just
can't
get
enough
this
relentlessly
upbeat
piece
of
synthpop
became
the
band's
first
uk
top
ten
hit
and
it
remains
one
of
their
best
known
songs
it
was
also
the
first
depeche
mode
song
to
get
a
music
video
and
is
the
only
one
of
the
band's
videos
to
feature
vince
clarke
depeche
mode's
debut
album
speak

spell
was
released
in
november
1981
and
peaked
at
number
ten
on
the
uk
album
charts
critical
reviews
were
mixed
–
melody
maker
described
it
as
a
great
album
one
they
had
to
make
to
conquer
fresh
audiences
and
please
the
fans
who
just
can't
get
enough[18]
while
rolling
stone
was
more
critical
calling
the
album
pgrated
fluff[19]
clarke
departs
wilder
joins
(1981–1982)
[edit]
during
the
touring
and
promotion
for
speak

spell
clarke
privately
began
to
voice
his
discomfort
at
the
direction
the
band
were
taking
he
later
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
saying
there
was
never
enough
time
to
do
anything
not
with
all
the
interviews
and
photo
sessions[20]
in
november
1981
clarke
publicly
announced
that
he
was
leaving
depeche
mode[21]
it
also
was
claimed
clarke
was
sick
of
touring
which
gahan
said
years
later
was
bullshit
to
be
quite
honest[15]
gahan
went
on
to
say
he
suddenly
lost
interest
in
it
and
he
started
getting
letters
from
fans
asking
what
kind
of
socks
he
wore[15]
soon
afterwards
clarke
joined
up
with
blues
singer
alison
moyet
to
form
yazoo
(yaz
in
the
us)
and
later
the
duo
erasure
with
andy
bell
initial
talk
of
clarke's
continuing
to
write
material
for
the
group
ultimately
amounted
to
nothing
according
to
thirdparty
sources
clarke
offered
the
remaining
members
of
depeche
mode
the
track
only
you
but
they
declined[22]
clarke
however
denied
in
an
interview
that
such
an
offer
ever
took
place
saying
i
don't
know
where
that
came
from
that's
not
true
[23]
the
song
went
on
to
become
a
uk
top
3
hit
for
yazoo
gore
who
had
written
tora!
tora!
tora!
and
the
instrumental
big
muff
for
speak

spell
was
forced
to
become
the
band's
new
songwriter[24]
in
late
1981
the
band
placed
an
anonymous
ad
in
melody
maker
looking
for
another
musician
it
said
name
band
synthesise
must
be
under
twentyone[11]
alan
wilder
a
keyboardist
from
west
london
responded
and
after
two
auditions
and
despite
being
22
years
old
he
was
hired
in
early
1982
initially
on
a
trial
basis
as
a
touring
member[25]
wilder
would
later
be
called
the
musical
director
of
the
band
responsible
for
the
band's
sound
until
his
departure
in
1995[6]
as
producer
flood
would
later
say
[alan]
is
sort
of
the
craftsman
martin's
the
idea
man
and
[dave]
is
the
attitude[6]
in
january
1982
the
band
released
see
you
their
first
single
without
clarke
which
managed
to
beat
all
three
clarkepenned
singles
in
the
uk
charts
reaching
number
six[26]
the
tour
that
followed
the
release
of
the
single
saw
the
band
playing
their
first
shows
in
north
america
two
more
singles
the
meaning
of
love
and
leave
in
silence
were
released
ahead
of
the
band's
second
studio
album
depeche
mode
began
work
on
their
second
album
in
july
1982
daniel
miller
informed
wilder
that
he
was
not
needed
for
the
recording
of
the
album
as
the
band
wanted
to
prove
that
they
could
succeed
without
vince
clarke[27]
a
broken
frame
was
released
that
september
and
the
following
month
the
band
set
off
on

(1983)
[edit]
for
their
third

depeche
mode
worked
with
producer
gareth
jones
at
john
foxx's
garden
studios
and
at
hansa
studios
in
west
berlin
(where
much
of
david
bowie's
trilogy
of
seminal
electronic
albums
featuring
brian
eno
had
been
produced)
the
album
saw
a
dramatic
shift
in
the
group's
sound
due
in
part
to
wilder's
introduction
of
the
synclavier
and
emu
emulator
samplers[29]
by
sampling
the
noises
of
everyday
objects
the
band
created
an
eclectic
industrialinfluenced
sound
with
similarities
to
groups
such
as
the
art
of
noise
and
einst&uumlrzende
neubauten
the
latter
later
having
work
released
on
the
mute
label[30]
along
with
the
music
gore's
songwriting
was
also
rapidly
evolving
focusing
increasingly
on
political
and
social
issues
a
good
example
of
the
new
sound
was
on
the
first
single
from
the
album
everything
counts
a
commentary
on
the
perceived
greed
of
multinational
corporations[31]
in
a
retrospective
review
of
the
single
allmusic
journalist
ned
raggett
wrote
that
the
song
marked
a
change
in
the
band
with
martin
gore's
songwriting
abilities
matched
with
an
increasing
ambition
of
the
band
as
a
whole[32]
everything

got
to
number
six
in
the
uk
also
reaching
the
top
30
in

two
songs
to

all
over

some
great

(1984)
and
international
success
[edit]
in
their
early
years
depeche
mode
had
only
really
attained
success
in
europe
and
australia
however
this
changed
in
march
1984
when
they
released
the
single
people

the
song
reached
no

in
ireland
no

in
uk
and
switzerland
and
no

in
west
germany

the
first
time
a

topped
a
country's
singles
chart

where
it
was
used
as
the
theme
to
west
german
tv's
coverage
of
the
1984
olympics[33]
it
belatedly
reached
no
13
on
the
us
charts
in
mid1985
the
song
has
since
become
an
anthem
for
the
lgbt
community
and
was
regularly
played
at
gay
establishments
and
gay
pride
festivals
in
the
late
1980s[34]
sire
the

the

noticed
things
were
changing
they
were
according
to
gore
shocked
by
the
way
the
fans
were
turning
up
in
droves
at
the
concerts[15]
he
said
that
although
the
concerts
were
selling
well
they
were
still
struggling
to
sell
records[15]
in
september
1984
some
great

claimed
that
the
album
made
one
sit
up
and
take
notice
of
what
is
happening
here
right
under
your
nose[35]
in
contrast
to
the
political
and
environmental
subjects
addressed
on
the
previous
album
the
songs
on
some
great
reward
were
mostly
concerned
with
more
personal
themes
such
as
sexual
politics
(master
and
servant)
adulterous
relationships
(lie
to
me)
and
arbitrary
divine
justice
(blasphemous
rumours)

then
i
think
'why
can't

just
go
[repeats

it?'
it's
obvious
you
spend
all

trying
to
get
a

to
try
and
create
this
sound
but
you
can
just
go

you've

it
then
you
can
send
it
through
some

device
after
that
and
you've

something
that
sounds
absolutely
nothing
like
a

the

depeche

were
recognised
in

years
as
a
synthpop
band
and
were
considered
teen
idols
following
the
departure
of
vince
clarke
their
music
began
to
take
on
a
darker
tone
as
martin
gore
assumed
lead
songwriting
duties
gore's
lyrical
artistry
has
been
recognised
as
encapsulating
themes
such
as
sex
religion
politics
racism
and
socialism[107]
so
much
so
that
many
labeled
the
band's
lyrical
and
musical
themes
as
dark
and
bleak
in
response
gore
stated
he
feels
lyrical
themes
which
tackle
issues
related
to
solitude
and
loneliness
present
more
of
a
realistic
character
and
are
a
better
representation
of
reality
whereas
he
finds
'happy
songs'
fake
and
unrealistic[108]
gore
also
added
i've
never
seen
our
music
as
being
overdark
i
think
that
there
is
always
an
