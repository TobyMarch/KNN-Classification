1995[1]
and
released

debut
ep
whole
in
april

nearly
every

on
the
band's
first
two
fulllength

find
a
friend
(1998)
and

(2000)
winners
marked
pedro
the
lion's
first
concept
album[2]
after
its
completion
bazan
has
claimed
he
initially
decided
not
to
continue
writing
concept
albums[2]
however
in
the
process
of
writing
his
next
fulllength
control
he
realized
he
had
inadvertently
created
a
narrative
link
about
70%
of
the
way
through
[the
album]
and
decided
to
finish
it
in
the
same
vein[2]
the
album's
thematic
content
criticizes
american
capitalism
which
bazan
notes
was
largely
inspired
by
the
sentiments
surrounding
the
world
trade
organization
protests
in
1999[2]
control

partnership
with
tw&nbspwalsh

the
band's
primary
writers
and
musicians[3]
bazan
described
the
tracks
in
the
third
fulllength
from
pedro
the
lion
as
a
return
to
the
songwriting
characterized
by
friend
and
the
secure&nbspep
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
pretense
of
anything
bigger
an
allusion
to
his
previous
concept
albums[2]
in
early
january
2006
