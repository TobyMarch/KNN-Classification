when
your

is
the
land
of
cotton
the
first
time
you
leave
it
can
be
strange
it
can
be
shocking
not
everybody
drives
a

not
everybody
drinks
sweet

not
everybody
owns
a

wears
a
ball
cap
boots

not

goes

every
nascar

when

i've
been
away
way
too
long
i
can't

this

unless

i
have
walked
the
streets
of
rome
i
have
been

i

to
talk
and

nobody

the

lit
up
on
a
paris
night
i
have
kissed
a
west
coast
girl
underneath
the
northern
lights
i
know
what
it's
like
to
meet
the
only
one
like
me
to
take
a
good
hard
look
around
and
be
a
minority
and
i
miss
my
tennessee

i
can
see
the
ways
that
i've
grown
i
can't

beat
this
summer
like
the
ferris
wheel
goes
around
and
around
well
the
trouble
with
up
is
there's
always
a
down
first
i'm
holding
your
hand
and
we're
on
the
boardwalk
there's
heaven
right
here
on
these
streets
and
these
docks
but
the
sun
keeps
setting
and
the
days
go
fast
and
the
sand
on
the
beach
is
like
an
hourglass
and
i
can
just
feel
it
i'm
slipping
away
and
babe
i
can
already
say
that
as
long
as
i
live
whatever
i
do
as
great
as
it
is
you
know
what's
a
bummer
i
ain't
never
gonna
beat
this
summer
with
you
baby
it's
true
the
taste
in
your
kiss
is
so
bittersweet
i
ain't
gonna
beat
no
way
i'm
gonna
beat
this
summer
with
you
before
you
know
it
it's
all
gonna
stop
they'll
be
rolling
up
windows
and
putting
up
tops
be
a
cold
wind
blowing
and
leaves
through
the
air
and
you
won't
find
a
tan
line
anywhere
maybe
i
know
that
it
ain't
over
yet
so
let's
make
the
most
of
what
we
have
left
but
it's
hard
living
for
this
moment
we're
in
knowing
it's
all
gonna
end
as
long
as
i
live
whatever
i
do
as
great
as
it
is
you
know
what's
a

i
ain't

i
ain't

no

i'm

this
summer
with
you
looking
at
you
girl
standing
there
got
your
wayfarers
on
and
the
sun
in
your
hair
and
just
like
the
song
in
a
seashell
you'll
be
stuck
in
mind
bouncing
around
in
my
head
and
baby
i
can
tell
as
long
as
i
live
whatever
i
do
as

pressing
on
a
bruise
you
were
a
pain
girl
a
thorn
in
my
side
drove
me
insane
girl
a
whiteknuckle
ride
so
why
do
i
go
lookin'
through
old
photographs
and
chase
you
down
the
hallways
of
our
checkered
past
hold
on
for
dear
life
and
keep
the
fire
fed
i
oughta
let
go
but
instead
it's
like
i'm
pressing
on
a
bruise
to
see
if
it
still
hurts
right
now
that's
all
i've
got
left
of
you
everybody
knows
that
just
makes
it
worse
but
still
i
do
i
could
start
a
new
life
i
could
move
on
i
could
do
a
drive
by
and
see
if
you're
home
now
there's
a
fine
fine
line
between
a
memory
and
something
any
shrink
would
call
an
injury
but
it's
not
over
long
as
you're
still
hurtin'
me
and
as
i
turn
onto
your
street
it's
like
i'm
pressing
on
a
bruise
to
see
if
it
still
hurts
right
now
that's
all
i've
got
left
of
you
anybody
knows
that
just
makes
it
worse
but
still
i
do
still
i
do
still
i
do
still
love
you
but
she's
the
kind
of
girl
puts
your
world
on
hold
walk
the
halls
and
you
check
your
phone
gave
up
the
ghost
and
the
ghost
keeps
holdin'
on
and
you
run
from
the
sun
but
you
curse
the
rain
lost
the
love
so
you
nurse
the
pain
goin'
on
and
on
singin'
that
same
song
but
she's
gone
(i
can't
let
it
alone)
and
you
get
drunk
on
those
glory
days
(i
can't
just
let
it
heal)
with
a
broken
heart
and
a
bitter
taste
(no
i
can't
just
let
it
go)
well
you
light
it
up
as
she
burns
you
down
(i
can't
just
let
it
heal)
you're
smokin'
those
memories
to
the
ground
(like
i'm
pressing
on
a
bruise)
yeah
that's
the
thing
about
love
and
pain
they
may
look
alike
but
they're
not
the
same
(no
i
can't
just
let
it
go)
you've
got
to
let
it
go
go
go

and
her

kicked

he
threw

she
spun
around
grabbed
his
arm
and
put
him
on
the
ground
grabbed
a
cuttin’
board
on
his
way
down
and
she
kicked
it
in
half
his
knees
hit
the
floor
his
chin
hit
a
chair
knocked
out
his
tooth
and
it
flew

line
had
flattened
ol’
harvey
just

how
she
treated
him
for

all

and
the

back
with

he
found
himself
reaching
for
the
phone
and
he
called
his
lawyer
he
called
his
priest
and
told
‘em
‘bout
how
they’d
restarted
his
heart
and
how
his
wedding
vows
were
technically
‘til
death
do
us
part
you’ll
probably
judge
me

across
town
you
can
hear
the
sound

weddin’
bells
ringin’

there’s
birdseed
on

she’s
wavin’

death
of
a
single
man
remember
when
we
got
the
news
confirming
our
worst
fears
i
said
he
wouldn’t
make
it
six
months
and
others
gave
him
a
year
and
sure
enough
last
saturday
we
paid
our
last
respects
he
left
us
here
still
in
this
life
and
he’s
gone
on
to
the
next
i’d
never
seen
him
wear
a
tie
but
he
looked
so
natural
almost
lifelike
the
preacher
spoke
his
mother
cried
when
he
said
“son
you
may
now
kiss
the
bride”
everyone
cheered
i
thought
how
odd
i
didn’t
understand
why
with
champagne
and
cake
we
celebrate
the
death
of
a
single
man
so
many
flowers
he
was
so
loved
prior
to
the
bride
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
maid
of
honor
should
be
disqualified
to
all
his
friends
it’s
a
wakeup
call
if
it
happened
to
him
it
can
happen
to
us
all
nothing
says
it’s
over
man
like
a
bad
80’s
cover
band
how
can
we
dance
to
my
sharona
at
the
death
of
a
single
man
he
was
so
young
so
full
of
dreams
before
the
day
he
fell
now
he’s
gone
on
to
a
better
place
or
possibly
to
hell
now
here
we
are
seems
so
unfair
it’s
poker
night
and
there’s
one
empty
chair
so
many
things
we’re
gonna
miss
his
happy
smile
and
that
great
laugh
of
his
i
think
of
him
in
the
afterwife
life
i
guess
all
good
things
must
end
so
with
jack
and
coke
we’ll
make
a
toast
to
the
death
of

at

you
understand

put
on

the
only
thing
i
meant

is
i’m
a

the

somehow
is
like

elephant
in

i
just
walked
him
right
in

just
a
proud
rebel
son
with
an
‘ol
can
of
worms
lookin’
like
i
got
a
lot
to
learn
but
from
my
point
of

i’m
just
a
white
man
comin’
to
you
from
the
southland
tryin’
to
understand
what
it’s
like
not

i’m
proud

we’ve

ain’t

can

our
generation
didn’t
start
this

we’re
still
pickin’
up
the
pieces
walkin’
on
eggshells
fightin’
over
yesterday
and
caught
between
southern
pride
and
southern
blame
they
called
it
reconstruction
fixed
the
buildings
dried
some
tears
we’re
still
siftin’
through
the
rubble
after
a
hundredfifty
years
i
try
to
put
myself
in
your
shoes
and
that’s
a
good
place
to
begin
but
it
ain’t
like
i
can
walk
a
mile
in
someone
else’s
skin
‘cause
i’m
a
white
man
livin’
in
the
southland
just
like
you
i’m
more
than
what
you
see
i’m

dear
mr
white
man
i
wish
you
understood
what
the
world
is
really
like
when
you’re
livin’
in
the
hood
just
because
my
pants
are
saggin’
doesn’t
mean
i’m
up
to
no
good
you
should
try
to
get
to
know
me
i
really
wish
you
would
now
my
chains
are
gold
but
i’m
still
misunderstood
i
wasn’t
there
when
sherman’s
march
turned
the
south
into
firewood
i
want
you
to
get
paid
but
be
a
slave
i
never
could
feel
like
a

fangled
django
dodgin’
invisible
white
hoods
so
when
i
see
that
white
cowboy
hat
i’m
thinkin’
it’s
not

we’re

guilty
of
judgin’

you

with
up
is
there's
always
a
down
first
i'm
holding
your
hand
and
we're
on
the
boardwalk
there's
heaven
right
here
on
these
streets
and
these
docks
but
the
sun
keeps
setting
and
the
days
go
fast
and
the
sand
on
the
beach
is
like
an
hourglass
and
i
can
just
feel
it
i'm
slipping
away
and
babe
i
can
already
say
that
as
long
as
i
live
whatever
i
do
as
great
as
it
is
you
know
what's
a
bummer
i
ain't
never
gonna
beat
this
summer
with
you
baby
it's
true
the
taste
in
your
kiss
is
so
bittersweet
i
ain't
gonna
beat
no
way
i'm
gonna
beat
this
summer
with
you
before
you
know
it
it's
all
gonna
stop
they'll
be
rolling
up
windows
and
putting
up
tops
be
a
cold
wind
blowing
and
leaves
through
the
air
and
you
won't
find
a
tan
line
anywhere
maybe
i
know
that
it
ain't
over
yet
so
let's
make
the
most
of
what
we
have
left
but
it's
hard
living
for
this
moment
we're
in
knowing
it's
all
gonna
end
as
long
as
i
live

i

with
you
looking
at
you
girl
standing
there
got
your
wayfarers
on
and
the
sun
in
your
hair
and
just
like
the
song
in
a
seashell
you'll
be
stuck
in
mind
bouncing
around
in
my
head
and
baby
i
can
tell
as
long
as

only
way
she'll
stay
i
sat
there
and
listened
to
the
reasons
i
was
given
as
to
why
her
bags
were
sittin'
by
the
door
in
great
detail
she
told
me
how
she
could
no
longer
live
here
and
it
just
wasn't
working
anymore
she
had
finally
finished
and
her
anger
had
diminished
well
i
took
her
hand
and
looked
her
in
the
eye
and
in
my
desperation
i
guess
somehow
i
explained
why
it
would
be
a
shame
to
leave
all
this
behind
and
i
talked
her
outta
leavin'
me
'cause
right
here's
where
she
needs
to
be
and
i
guess
i
should
feel
a
need
but
somehow
i
don't
through

she
held
to
one
stipulation
if
i
really
want
to
keep
her
here
at
home
then
the
only
way
she'll
stay
is
if
i
don't
well
she
picked
up
her
bags
and
as
she
walked
back
to
the
bedroom
i
just
scratched
my
head
and
sat
there
for
a
while
she's
actin'
like
she's
doin'
me
a
favor
but
i
don't
see
how
she
thinks
that
this
could
be
a
compromise
and
i'm
lookin'
for
the
bright
side
of
this
bittersweet
conclusion
as
it's
my
turn
now
to
pack
up
all
my
things
and
i
guess
that
i
accomplished
all
that
i
set
out
to
do
'cause
now
i
don't
have
to
watch
her
walk
away
yeah
i

never
really
got
over

a
single
working
taillight
on
the
trailer
that
she
rented
slowly
disappeared
around
the
bend
and
i
stood
there
in
silence
wondering
where
she
might
be
headed
as
a
chapter
from
my
life
came
to
an
end
i
was
so
sure
i'd
found
the
right
one
i
took
my
heart
out
on
a
limb
i
know
she
really
tried
to
love
me
but
she
never
really
got
over
him
she
told
me
when
i
met
her
about
all
those
painful
memories
the
way
that
love
treated
her
before
how
she
gave
her
heart
to
someone
believing
in
forever
just
to
see
it
carried
out
the
door
still
i
believed
that
this
was
something
that
a
little
love
and
time
would
surely
mend
and
i
gave
her
everything
i
could
have
but
she
never
really
got
over
him
first
loves
die
hard
you
just
can't
erase
the
past
when
every
emotion
brings
back
memories
of
him
now
how
can
i
compete
with
that
well
i
haven't
heard
about
her
lately
but
i
think
about
her
now
and
then
and
it's
a
shame
but
i'd
be
willing
to
bet
that
she
never
really
got
over
him
you
know
i
never
really
got
over
her

an

gift
at

away
and
it's
easy
to
take
forever
for

with
tin
cans
tied
to
your

i
know
she
tells
you
that
she'll
always
be
there

i'm
telling
you
if
you're
smart

you'll
love
her

sittin'

mall
he
sat
down
in
his
overalls
and
asked
me
you
waitin'
on
a

i
nodded
yeah
and
said
how
'bout
you
he
said
son
since
nineteen
fiftytwo
i've
been
waitin'
on
a
woman
when
i
picked
her
up
for
our
first
date
i
told
her
i'd
be
there
at
eight
and
she
came
down
the
stairs
at
eightthirty
she
said
i'm
sorry
that
i
took
so
long
didn't
like
a
thing
that
i
tried
on
but
let
me
tell
you
son
she
sure
looked
pretty
yeah
she'll
take
her
time
but
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
he
said
the
wedding
took
a
year
to
plan
you
talk
about
an
anxious
man
i
was
nervous
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
then
he
nudged
my
arm
like
old
men
do
and
said
i'll
say
this
about
the
honeymoon
it
was
worth
it
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
i
don't
guess
we've
been
anywhere
she
hasn't
made
us
late
i
swear
sometimes
she
does
it
just
'cause
she
can
do
it
boy
it's
just
a
fact
of
life
it'll
be
the
same
with
your
young
wife
might
as
well
go
on
and
get
used
to
it
she'll
take
her
time
'cause
you
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
i've
read
somewhere
statistics
show
the
man's
always
the
first
to
go
and
that
makes
sense
'cause
i
know
she
won't
be
ready
so
when
it
finally
comes
my
time
and
i
get
to
the
other
side
i'll
find
myself
a
bench
if
they've
got
any
i
hope
she
takes
her
time
'cause
i
don't

no

when
you
break
up
after
seven
months
and
yeah
i

you
really
liked
her
and
it
just
don't
seem
fair
all
i

it's

friday
night
she
wasn't
right
for
you
and
still
you
feel
like
there's
a
knife
sticking
out
of
your
back
and
you're
wondering
if
you'll
survive
you'll
make
it
through
this

you'll
see
you're
still
around
to
write
this

at

turns

kinda
cool
each
and
every
time
you
have

fight
just
assume
you're
wrong
and
daddy
is
right
and
you
should
really
thank
mrs

you

falls
asleep

does

him

three

later
in

goodnight
i
hadn't
told
you
yet
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
now
you're
my
whole
life
now
you're
my
whole

i
just
can't
believe
the
way
i

about
you
girl
like
a
river

the

stronger
than

ever
been
we've
come
so

since
that
day
and

i
loved
you
then
i
remember
taking
you
back
to
right
where
i
first
met
you
you
were
so
suprised
there
were
people
around
but
i
didn't
care
i
got
down
on
one
knee
right
there
and
once
again
i
thought
i
loved
you

you
with
a
baby
on
the
way
i
can
just
see
you
when
your
hair
is
turning
grey
what
i
can't
see
is
how
i'm
ever
gonna
love
you
more
but
i've
said
that
before

build

on
my
fifth
birthday
i
got
so
upset
about
the
brand
new
bike
that
i
didn't
get
i'd
prayed
my
heart
out
and
it
didn't
seem
fair
i
told
my
grandpa
i
guess
god
doesn't
care
and
he
just
smiled
and
said
my
child
make
no
mistake
every
prayer
you
pray
gets
answered
even
though
sometimes
the
answer
is
no
five
years
later
out
behind
the
shed
with
a
stolen
pack
of
grandpa's
cigarettes
i
struck
a
match
and
held
that
first
one
to
my
lips
and
prayed
to
god
please
let
me
get
away
with
this
and
through
the
smoke
i
saw
grandpa
standing
there
make
no
mistake
every
prayer
you
pray
gets
answered
even

sometimes
the
answer
is
no

i
think
of
all
the
answers
in
my
life
i
would
have
to
say
there's
no
doubt
it
was
always
for
the
best
when
i
didn't
get
my
way
grandpa
got
older
like
grandpas
do
his
health
was
failing
and
i
guess
i
knew
it'd
be
best
if
he
was
called
on
hold
but
selfishly
i
prayed
that
god
would
keep
him
hanging
on
and
when
he
passed
away
in
my
mind
i
heard
him
say
make
no
mistake
every
prayer
you
pray

waitin'
on
a
woman
sittin'
on
a
bench
at
west
town
mall
he
sat
down
in
his
overalls
and
asked
me
you
waitin'
on
a
woman
i
nodded
yeah
and
said
how
'bout
you
he
said
son
since
nineteen
fiftytwo
i've
been
waitin'
on
a
woman
when
i
picked
her
up
for
our
first
date
i
told
her
i'd
be
there
at
eight
and
she
came
down
the
stairs
at
eightthirty
she
said
i'm
sorry
that
i
took
so
long
didn't
like
a
thing
that
i
tried
on
but
let
me
tell
you
son
she
sure
looked
pretty
yeah
she'll
take
her
time
but
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
he
said
the
wedding
took
a
year
to
plan
you
talk
about
an
anxious
man
i
was
nervous
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
then
he
nudged
my
arm
like
old
men
do
and
said
i'll
say
this
about
the
honeymoon
it
was
worth
it
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
i
don't
guess
we've
been
anywhere
she
hasn't
made
us
late
i
swear
sometimes
she
does
it
just
'cause
she
can
do
it
boy
it's
just
a
fact
of
life
it'll
be
the
same
with
your
young
wife
might
as
well
go
on
and
get
used
to
it
she'll
take
her
time
'cause
you
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
i've
read
somewhere
statistics
show
the
man's
always
the
first
to
go
and
that
makes
sense
'cause
i
know
she
won't
be
ready
so
when
it
finally
comes
my
time
and
i
get
to
the
other
side
i'll
find
myself
a
bench
if
they've
got
any
i
hope
she
takes
her
time
'cause
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
honey
take
your

an

playing
and
i
can't
believe
they
all
belong

talk
about
an
anxious
man
i
was
nervous
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
then
he
nudged
my
arm
like
old
men
do
and
said
i'll
say
this
about
the
honeymoon
it
was
worth
it
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
i
don't
guess
we've
been
anywhere
she
hasn't
made
us
late
i
swear
sometimes
she
does
it
just
'cause
she
can
do
it
boy
it's
just
a
fact
of
life
it'll
be
the
same
with
your
young
wife
might
as
well
go
on
and
get
used
to
it
she'll
take
her
time
'cause
you
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
i've
read
somewhere
statistics
show
the
man's
always
the
first
to
go
and
that
makes
sense
'cause
i
know
she
won't
be
ready
so
when
it
finally
comes
my
time
and
i
get
to
the
other
side
i'll
find
myself
a
bench
if
they've
got
any
i
hope
she
takes
her
time
'cause
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
honey
take
your
time
cause
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on

some
mistakes
you
may
think
i'm
wrong
for
you
and
you're
wrong
for
me
to
look
at
us
on
paper
i
would
have
to
agree
it
could
have

the
moon
light

it
could

the

it

oh
we're
do
we
go
from
here
i
don't
know
but
baby
one
thing's
clear
some
mistakes
are
too
much
fun
to
only
make
once
there's
this
little
straight
stretch
just
south
of
here
it's
great
for
mashing
down
the
gas
and
trying
out
fifth
gear
but
it's
also
a
speed
trap
twice
i've
gotten
caught
but
something
bout
it
calls
to
me
and
i
can't
seem
to
stop
and
oh
you
have
the
same
effect
i
know
i'll
just
keep
coming
back
some
mistakes
are
too
much
fun
to
only
make
once
well
there
are
things
in
life
that
i
regret
and
even
more
that
haven't
happened
yet
but
it
would
be
a
shame
if
our
little
fling
always
stayed
a
onetime
thing
someday
if
we're
lucky
we'll
get
old
enough
to
finally
be
embarrassed
by
the
crazy
things
we've
done
be
just
like
our
parents
responsible
and
bland
no
risk
no
excitement
hey
lets
get
it
while
we
can
cause
some

if
i
could
write
a
letter
to
me
and
send
it
back
in
time
to
myself
at
17
first
i'd
prove
it's
me
by
saying
look
under
your
bed
there's
a
skoal
can
and
a
playboy
no
one
else
would
know
you
hid
and
then
i'd
say
i
know
its
tough
when
you
break
up
after
seven
months
and
yeah
i
know
you
really
liked
her
and
it
just
don't
seem
fair
all
i
can
say
is
pain
like
that
is
fast
and
it's
rare
[1st
chorus]
and
oh
you
got
so
much
going
for
you
going
right
but
i
know
at
17
it's
hard
to
see
past
friday
night
she
wasn't
right
for
you
and
still
you
feel
like
there's
a
knife
sticking
out
of
your
back
and
you're
wondering
if
you'll
survive
you'll
make
it
through
this
and
you'll
see
you're
still
around
to
write
this
letter
to
me
at
the
stop
sign
at
tomlinson
and
eighth
always
stop
completely
don't
just
tap
your
brakes
and
when
you
get
a
date
with
bridgett
make
sure
the
tank
is
full
on
second
thought
forget
it
that
one
turns
out
kinda
cool
each
and
every
time
you
have
a
fight
just
assume
you're
wrong
and
daddy
is
right
and
you
should
really
thank
mrs
bringman
she
spend
so
much
extra
time
it's
like
she
sees
the
diamond
underneath
and
she's
polishing
you
'til
you
shine
[2nd

and
oh
you
got
so
much
going
for
you
going
right
but
i
know
at
17
it's
hard
to
see
past
friday
night
tonight's
the
bonfire
rally
but
you're
staying
home
instead
because
if
you
fail
algebra
mom
and
dad
will
kill
you
dead
trust
me
you'll
squeak
by
and
get
a
c
and
you're
still
around
to
write
this
letter
to
me
you've
got
so
much
up
ahead
you'll
make
new
friends
you
should
see
your
kids
and
wife
and
i'd
end
up
saying
have
no
fear
these
are
nowhere
near
the
best
years
of
your
life
i
guess
i'll
see
you
in
the
mirror
when
you're
a

man
ps
go
hug

at
west
town
mall
he
sat
down
in
his
overalls
and
asked
me
you
waitin'
on
a
woman
i
nodded
yeah
and
said
how
'bout
you
he
said
son
since
nineteen
fiftytwo
i've
been
waitin'
on
a
woman
when
i
picked
her
up
for
our
first
date
i
told
her
i'd
be
there
at
eight
and
she
came
down
the
stairs
at
eightthirty
she
said
i'm
sorry
that
i
took
so
long
didn't
like
a
thing
that
i
tried
on
but
let
me
tell
you
son
she
sure
looked
pretty
yeah
she'll
take
her
time
but
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
he
said
the
wedding
took
a
year
to
plan
you
talk
about
an
anxious
man
i
was
nervous
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
then
he
nudged
my
arm
like
old
men
do
and
said
i'll
say
this
about
the
honeymoon
it
was
worth
it
waitin'
on
a
woman
and
i
don't
guess
we've
been
anywhere
she
hasn't
made
us
late
i
swear
sometimes
she
does
it
just
'cause
she
can
do
it
boy
it's
just
a
fact
of
life
it'll
be
the
same
with
your
young
wife
might
as
well
go
on
and
get
used
to
it
she'll
take
her
time
'cause
you
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
i've
read
somewhere
statistics
show
the
man's
always
the
first
to
go
and
that
makes
sense
'cause
i
know
she
won't
be
ready
so
when
it
finally
comes
my
time
and
i
get
to
the
other
side
i'll
find
myself
a
bench
if
they've
got
any
i
hope
she
takes
her
time
'cause
i
don't
mind
waitin'
on
a
woman
honey
take
your
time

well
i'll
never
forget
the
first
time
that
i
heard
that
pretty
mouth
say
that
dirty
word
and
i
can't
even
remember
now
what
she
backed
my
truck
into
but
she
covered
her
mouth
and
her
face
got
red
and
she
just
looked
so
darn
cute
that
i
couldn't
even
act
like
i
was
mad
yeah
i
live
for
little
moments
like
that
well
that's
just
like
this
last
year
on
my
birthday
she
lost
all
track
of
time
and
burnt
the
cake
and
every
smoke
detector
in
the
house
was
goin'
off
and
she
was
just
about
to
cry
until
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
i
tried
not
to
let
her
see
me
laugh
yeah
i
live
for
little
moments
like
that
i
know
she's
not
perfect
but
she
tries
so
hard
for
me
and
i
thank
god
that
she
isn't
'cause
how
boring
would
that
be
it's
the
little
imperfections
it's
the
sudden
change
in
plans
when
she
misreads
the
directions
and
we're
lost
but
holdin'
hands
yeah
i
live
for
little
moments
like
that
when
she's
layin'
on
my
shoulder
on
the
sofa
in
the
dark
and
about
the
time
she
falls
asleep
so
does
my
right
arm
and
i
want
so
bad
to
move
it
'cause
it's
tinglin'
and
it's
numb
but
she
looks
so
much
like
an
angel
that
i
don't
wanna
wake
her
up
yeah
i
live
for
little
moments
when
she
steals
my
heart
again
and
doesn't
even
know
it
yeah
i
live
for
little
moments

the

of
you
should

if

to
do

right
just
take
my
advice
all
you
really
need
is
love
and
a
license
and
a
blood
test
and
a
bunch
of
invitations
a
minister
a
white

and
of

a

flowers
and
music
and
candles
and

you're

pale
is
everything

don't
worry
you'll
be
fine

you
just
keep
in

all
you
really
need
is
love
and
bridesmaids
and
groomsmen
and
a
wedding
coordinator
and
food
for
the
reception
you'll
need
someone
to
cater
did
i
forget
to
mention
it'll
take
a
couple
rings
and
of
course
a
pa
system
if
you're
wantin'
me
to
sing
now
you
look
so
happy
you
could
cry
and
that
explains
the
tear

i

in

don't

sit

talk

me

we'd
never
get
along
i'm

there's
no
chemistry
at

this
has
been
a
waste
of

who
needs
pictures
there's
an
old
kodak
camera
in
my
dresser
drawer
i
ran
across
it
just
this
afternoon
and
i
realized
that
i
don't
ever
use
it
anymore
in
fact
last
time
i
did
i
think
it
was
with
you
when
we
were
down
in
cozumel
we
had
the
whole
beach
to
ourselves
and
it's
crazy
now
to
think
that
it's
all
there
on
that
film
and
i
could
take
it
to
the
store
to
be
developed
but
what
for
i
can
still
see
everything
just
fine
and
who
needs
pictures
with
a
memory
like
mine
standin'
there
i
couldn't
help
but
think
about
everything
that
might
be
on
that
roll
i
think
it
even
has
another
trip
we
took
i
guess
that
must've
been
at
least
three
years
ago
when
we
were
down
in
baton
rouge
and
there
wasn't
much
to
do
so
we
drove
into
new
orleans
every
afternoon
and
i
swear
that
you
would
think
that
it
was
only
yesterday
'cause
i
can
still
see
everything
just
fine
who
needs
pictures
with
a
memory
like
mine
somewhere
in
my
closet
there's
a
cardboard
box
just
sittin'
on
a
shelf
it's
full
of
faded
memories
and
it's
been
there
ever
since
the
night
you
left
oh
just
forgotten
photographs
to
remind
me
of
the
past
oh
but
i
can
still
see
everything
just
fine
who
needs
pictures
with
a
memory
like
mine
yeah
who
needs
pictures
with
a

we

was

was
sweeping
up
the
floor
that's
when
she
walked
in
i
said
i'm
sorry
but
we're
closed
and
she
said
i
know
but
i'm
afraid
i
left
my
purse
i
said
i
put
one
back
behind
the
bar
i

it's
probably
yours
and
the
next
thing
that
i
knew
there
we
were
lost
in
conversation
and
before
i
handed
her
her
purse
i
said
you'll
only
get
this
back

out
there
on

empty
hardwood
floor
the

turned

the

played
we
held
each

close

from

moment
there
was
never
any
doubt
i
had
found
the
one
that
i
had
always
dreamed
about
and
then
one
evenin'
when
she
stopped
by
after
work
i
pulled
a
diamond
ring
out
of
the
pocket
of
my
shirt
and
as
her
eyes
filled
up
with
tears
she
said
this
is
the
last
thing
i
expected
and
then
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
i'll
only
marry
you
on
one
condition
[chorus]
like
no
one
else
had
ever
danced
before
i
can't
explain
what
happened
on
that
floor

he
didn't
have

be
when
a
single
mom
goes
out
on
a
date
with
somebody
new
it
always
winds
up
feeling
more
like
a
job
interview
my
momma
used
to
wonder
if
she'd
ever
meet
someone
who
wouldn't
find
out
about
me
and
then
turn
around
and
run
i
met
the
man
i
call
my
dad
when
i
was
five
years
old
he
took
my
mom
out
to
a
movie
and
for
once
i
got
to
go
a
few
months
later
i
remember
lying
there
in
bed
i
overheard
him
pop
the
question
and
prayed
that
she'd
say
yes
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
oh
it
seemed
so
strange
to
me
how
we
went
from
something's
missing
to
a
family
lookin'
back
all
i
can
say
about
all
the
things
he
did
for
me
is
i
hope
i'm
at
least
half
the
dad
that
he
didn't
have
to
be
i
met
the
girl
that's
now
my
wife
about
three
years
ago
we
had
the
perfect
marriage
but
we
wanted
somethin'
more
now
here
i
stand
surrounded
by
our
family
and
friends
crowded
'round
the
nursery
window
as
they
bring
the
baby
in
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
it
seemed
so
strange
to
me
how
we've
gone
from
something's
missing
to
a
family
lookin'
through
the
glass
i
think
about
the
man
that's
standin'
next
to
me

i'm
at

that
you
spent
a
year
in

and
the
salesman
you
were
seein'
you
hang
out
at

seven

you
doubled
