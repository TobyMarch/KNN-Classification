a

bands
and
albums
based
on
what
you’ve
chosen
i
got
the
latest
vampire
weekend
album
and
an
intro
to
radiohead
—
accurate
if
not
necessarily
relevant
choices
it’s
still
however
a
warm
welcome
to
the
world
of
beats
since
most
other
music
apps
just
plop
you
onto
a
new
releases
page
upon
signing
up
once
you’re
in
you
can
explore
beats’
20+
million
track
catalog
which
the
company
claims
is
nearly
identical
to
what
you’d
find
inside
spotify
'the
sentence'
lets
you
mad
lib
your
music
if
you
head
back
to
the
app’s
home
screen
then
swipe
over
you’ll
find
the
sentence
beats
music’s
real
bread
and
butter
in
the
sentence
you
fill
out
a
mad
lib
filled
with
feelings
locations
and
scenarios
in
order
to
find
the
right
track
for
your
mood
my
first
try
was
i’m
in
bed
and
feel
like
waking
up
with
your
mom
to
musica
mexicana
for
this
mood
the
app
offered
me
la
trampa
by
mexican
singersongwriter
ana
barbara
the
sentence
is
an
interesting
angle
on
songza’s
pick
your
moment
radio
stations
but
is
perhaps
a
bit
deceptive
since
the
final
fillintheblank
is
a
genre
which
seemingly
provides
most
of
the
impetus
for
which
song
starts
playing
if
you
don’t
feel
like
mad
libbing
you
can
also
pick
one
of
beats’
activity
playlists
like
breaking
up
or
one
of
the
artistoriented
playlists
curated
by
beats
itself
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
thoughtfully
crafted
playlists
like
belle

sebastian
songs
about
childhood
which
went
beyond
a
simple
group
of
deep
cuts
beats
music
on
the
web
in
my
tests
beats’
curation
was
impressive
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
songza
or
pandora
for
everyday
listening
those
services
intermix
both
humans
and
algorithms
while
beats
seemingly
favors
editorial
curation
the
bigger
problem
i
had
with
beats
music
however
was
its
offline
mode
like
rdio
beats
music
struggles
when
you
have
limited
or
no
connectivity
even
if
you’re
trying
to
listen
to
music
you’ve
saved
to
offline
mode
if
you’ve
gotten
on
the
subway
or
turned
on
airplane
mode
the
app
doesn’t
realize
you’ve
lost
connectivity
and
keeps
trying
to
connect
after
a
few
subway
rides
during
the
day
the
beats
music
app
got
pretty
annoying
visually
beats
is
a
goodlooking
app
its
now
playing
screen
is
refreshingly
different
overlaying
a
giant
play
/
pause
button
over
album
art
there
are
also
like
and
dislike
buttons
like
in
pandora
a
share
button
and
a
plus
sign
that
lets
you
add
music
to
a
playlist
or
save
it
offline
like
rdio
beats
lets
you
save
music
to
a
centralized
library
which
is
convenient
since
navigating
the
app's
interface
can
be
a
bit
clumsy
and
illogical
downloading
tracks
for
offline
mode
is
speedy
but
picking
and
playing
tracks
is
noticeably
slower
than
in
an
app
like
spotify
which
makes
playback
speed
its
top
priority
no
matter
which
way
you
slice
it
beats
music
is
very
late
to
the
game
no
matter
which
way
you
slice
it
beats
music
is
very
late
to
the
game
the
service
gets
off
on
the
right
foot
by
launching
on
iphone
android
windows
phone
and
web
—
but
in
the
digital
music
space
your
friends
and
what
they’re
listening
to
are
increasingly
important
many
of
them
are
on
spotify
some
are
on
rdio
a
couple
are
on
google
music
and
none
of
them
are
on
beats
music
this
is
the
old
chickenandegg
problem
of
course
but
despite
its
daring
first
effort
beats
music
doesn’t
provide
enough
value
added
to
convince
me
to
switch
the
company’s
business
model
also
leaves
a
few
questions
unanswered
beats
hopes
to
build
a
solid
user
base
of
paying
subscribers
yet
spotify
says
that
just
20
percent
of
its
users
pay
for
the
service
also
beats’
web
player
is
far
buggier
and
has
fewer
features
(the
sentence
is
absent)
than
its
mobile
app
and
other
competing
services
but
perhaps
beats
music
doesn’t
need
to
win
me
over
beats
has
a
strong
brand
presence
thanks
to
its
iconic
headphones
and
seemingly
tons
of
money
to
spend
on
marketing
beats’
audience
might
also
not
care
for
powerusery
settings
the
way
i
do
change
your
facebook
settings
so
you
can
share
the
goods
you’re
listening
to
the
app
beckoned
when
i
tried
to
enable
facebook
sharing
if
beats
is
smart
it
will
offer
several
months
of
free
music
to
anyone
who
buys
a
pair
of
its
headphones
in
hopes
that
they’ll
stay
on
afterwards
investing
in
the
future
in
such
a
way
might
be

only
way
to
catch
up
with
