formation
and
debut
album
(1994–1995)
[edit]
dave
grohl
(pictured
in
2006)
founded
foo
fighters
after
his
previous
band
nirvana
broke
up
in
1994
grohl
joined
the
grunge
group
nirvana
as
its
drummer
in
1990
during
tours
he
took
a
guitar
with
him
and
wrote
songs
grohl
held
back
these
songs
from
the
rest
of
the
band
he
said
in
1997
i
was
in
awe
of
[frontman
kurt
cobain's
songs]
and
[i
was]
intimidated
i
thought
it
was
best
that
i
kept
my
songs
to
myself[4]
grohl
occasionally
booked
studio
time
to
record
demos
and
covers
of
songs
he
liked
and
even
issued
a
cassette
of
some
of
those
songs
called
pocketwatch
under
the
pseudonym
late!
in
1992[5]
frontman
kurt
cobain
was
found
dead
in
his
seattle
home
on
april
8
1994
and
nirvana
subsequently
disbanded
grohl
received
offers
to
work
with
various
artists
he
almost
accepted
a
permanent
position
as
drummer
in
tom
petty
and
the
heartbreakers
ultimately
grohl
declined
and
instead
entered
robert
lang
studios
in
october
1994
to
record
fifteen
of
the
forty
songs
he
had
written[5]
with
the
exception
of
a
guitar
part
on
xstatic
played
by
greg
dulli
of
the
afghan
whigs
dave
grohl
played
every
instrument
and
sang
every
vocal
on
the
tracks[6]
i
was
supposed
to
just
join
another
band
and
be
a
drummer
the
rest
of
my
life
grohl
later
said
i
thought
that
i
would
rather
do
what
no
one
expected
me
to
do
i
enjoy
writing
music
and
i
enjoy
trying
to
sing
and
there's
nothing
anyone
can
really
do
to
discourage
me
grohl
completed
an
album's
worth
of
material
in
five
days
and
handed
out
cassette
copies
of
the
sessions
to
his
friends
for
feedback[5]
grohl
hoped
to
keep
his
anonymity
and
release
the
recordings
in
a
limited
run
under
the
title
foo
fighters
taken
from
the
world
war
ii
term
foo
fighter
used
to
refer
to
unidentified
flying
objects[5]
however
the
demo
tape
circulated
in
the
music
industry
creating
interest
among
record
labels[7]
grohl
formed
a
band
to
support
the
album
initially
he
talked
to
former
nirvana
band
mate
krist
novoselic
about
joining
the
group
but
both
decided
against
it
for
krist
and
i
it
would
have
felt
really
natural
and
really
great
grohl
explained
but
for
everyone
else
it
would
have
been
weird
and
it
would
have
left
me
in
a
really
bad
position
then
i
really
would
have
been
under
the
microscope[8]
having
heard
about
the
disbanding
of
seattlebased
rock
band
sunny
day
real
estate
grohl
drafted
the
group's
bass
player
nate
mendel
and
drummer
william
goldsmith
grohl
asked
pat
smear
who
served
as
a
touring
guitarist
for
nirvana
after
the
release
of
its
1993
album
in
utero
to
join
as
the
group's
second
guitarist[9]
grohl
ultimately
licensed
the
album
to
capitol
records
releasing
it
on
his
new
record
label

the
march

to

the
finances
of
the

after

foo
fighters
entered
bear
creek
studio
in
woodinville
washington
with
producer
gil
norton
to
record
its
second
album
while
grohl
once
again
wrote
all
the
songs
the
rest
of
the
band
collaborated
on
the
arrangements
with
the
sessions
nearly
complete
grohl
took
the
rough
mixes
with
him
to
los
angeles
intending
to
finish
up
his
vocal
and
guitar
parts
while
there
grohl
realized
that
he
was
not
happy
with
how
the
mixes
were
turning
out
and
the
band
basically
rerecorded
almost
everything[4]
during
the
la
sessions
grohl
had
played
drums
on
the
songs
unhappy
with
goldsmith's
drumming
grohl
removed
it
from
the
recordings
and
rerecorded
the
drum
tracks
as
goldsmith
was
about
to
come
down
to
la
to
find
out
why
he
wasn't
being
called
upon
to
rerecord
his
parts
he
called
mendel
from
seattle
inquiring
if
he
should
make
the
trip
grohl
then
called
goldsmith
saying
dude
don't
come
down
here
i'm
recording
some
of
the
drum
tracks
shocked
by
this
goldsmith
met
up
with
mendel
in
seattle
and
repeated
grohl's
claim
to
be
rerecording
some
of
the
tracks
mendel
asked
is
that
what
he
told
you?
goldsmith
affirmed
it
and
mendel
stated
no
man

he
did
them
all
longtime
drummer
taylor
hawkins
(pictured

joined
the

in
1997
grohl
explained
that
he'd
wanted
the
drums
to
sound
a
certain
way
on
the
album
he
wanted
goldsmith
to
play
for
the
tour
even
though
it
would
not
be
his
drumming
but
grohl's
on
the
album
feeling
betrayed
goldsmith
left
the
band
to
this
day
grohl
still
feels
guilty
for
his
decision
saying
i
was
an
immature
kid
at
the
time
however
he
felt
that
he
did
what
he
had
to
do
to
give
the
record
the
right
sound
and
make
it
successful[10]
in
need
of
a
replacement
for
goldsmith
grohl
contacted
alanis
morissette's
touring
drummer
taylor
hawkins
to
see
if
he
could
recommend
anybody
grohl
was
surprised
when
hawkins
volunteered
his
own
services
as
drummer[4]

made
his
debut

leave

and
burnout
but
agreed
to
stay

be
found

were
unable

[edit]
near
the
end
of
2001
the
band
reconvened
to
record
its
fourth
album
after
spending
four
months
in
a
los
angeles
studio
completing
the
album
the
album
just
didn't
sound
right
and
the
band
had
no
confidence
in
the
album
to
sell
many
records
with
the
album
not
reaching
their
expectations
and
much
infighting
amongst
the
members
grohl
spent
some
time
helping
queens
of
the
stone
age
complete
their
2002
album
songs
for
the
deaf
once
the
queens
of
the
stone
age
album
was
finished
and
touring
had
started
for
both
foo
fighters
and
queens
of
the
stone
age
the
band
was
on
the
verge
of
breaking
up
entirely
as
the
animosity
grew
amongst
the
members
grohl
reconvened
with
hawkins
shiflett
and
mendel
to
have
them
play
at
the
coachella
festival
with
queens
of
the
stone
age
playing
one
day
and
foo
fighters
the
following
after
the
queens
of
the
stone
age
played
hawkins
and
grohl
talked
about
retrying
the
one
by
one
album
and
had
agreed
to
finishing
it
and
seeing
where
they
would
go
from
there
the
group
went
and
rerecorded
nearly
all
of
the
album
(save
tired
of
you)
in
a
tenday
stretch
at
grohl's
home
studio
in
alexandria
virginia[13]
the
original
version
of
one
by
one
referred
by
the
band
as
million
dollar
demos[18]
has
never
been
heard
in
its
entirety
except
for
snippets
which
leaked
before
the
album's
premiere
and
a
few
more
snippets
leaked
by
a
fan
on
the
band's
website
in
2007
two
songs
from
these
sessions
were
leaked
in
2012
the
final
album
was
released
in
october
2002
under
the
title
one
by
one
singles
from
the
album
included
all
my
life
times
like
these
low
and
have
it
all
for
most
of
its
history
the
band
chose
to
stay
away
from
the
political
realm
however
in
2004
upon
learning
that
george
w
bush's
presidential
campaign
was
using
times
like
these
at
rallies
grohl
decided
to
lend
his
public
support
to
john
kerry's
campaign

there’s
no
way
of
stopping
the
president
playing
your
songs
so
i
went
out
and
played
it
for
john
kerry’s
people
instead
where
i
thought
the
message
would
kinda
make
more
sense[19]
grohl
attended
several
kerry
rallies
and
occasionally
performed
solo
acoustic
sets
the
entire
band
eventually
joined
grohl
for
a
performance
in
arizona
coinciding
with
one
of
the
presidential
debates[20]
in
your
honor

musical
style
and
legacy
[edit]
when
grohl
first
started
the
band
its
music
was
often
compared
to
that
of
his
previous
group
nirvana
grohl
acknowledged
that
nirvana
singer/guitarist
kurt
cobain
was
a
major
influence
on
his
songwriting
grohl
said
through
kurt
i
saw
the
beauty
of
minimalism
and
the
importance
of
music
that's
stripped
down
foo
fighters
also
utilize
the
technique
of
shifting
between
quiet
verses
and
loud
choruses
which
grohl
said
was
influenced
by
the
members
of
nirvana
liking
the
knack
bay
city
rollers
beatles
and
abba
as
much
as
we
liked
flipper
and
black
flag
i
suppose[4]
writing
and
recording
songs
for
the
first
foo
fighters
album
by
himself
grohl
wrote
the
guitar
riffs
to
be
as
rhythmic
as
possible
he
approached
the
guitar
in
a
similar
manner
to
his
playing
a
drumkit
assigning
different
drum
parts
to
different
strings
on
the
instrument
this
allowed
him
to
piece
together
songs
easily
he
said
i
could
hear
the
song
in
my
head
before
it
was
finished[5]
once
grohl
assembled
a
full
band
his
bandmates
assisted
in
song
arrangements[4]
the
members
of
foo
fighters
meld
melodic
elements
with
heavier
ones
grohl
noted
in
1997
we
all
love
music
whether
it's
the
beatles
or
queen
or
punk
rock
i
think
the
lure
of
punk
rock
was
the
energy
and
immediacy
the
need
to
thrash
stuff
around
but
at
the
same
time
we're
all
suckers
for
a
beautiful
melody
you
know?
so
it
is
just
natural[4]
grohl
said
in
2005
i
love
being
in
a
rock
band
but
i
don't
know
if
i
necessarily
wanna
be
in
an
alternative
rock
band
from
the
1990s
for
the
rest
of
my
life
grohl
noted
that
the
band's
acoustic
tour
was
such
an
attempt
to
broaden
the
group's
sound[51]

wanted
