the
singular
genius
of
depeche
mode’s
music
might
be
the
way
their
songs
inspire
a
gutwrenching
personal
response
the
best
music
is
of
course
meant
to
do
this
but
when
depeche
mode
started
their
career
in
the
early
’80s
pop
music
was
as
expendable
as
it
was
in
the
1950s
a
product
meant
for
easy
use
and
disposal
mindless
music
was
a
byproduct
of
the
boundless
consumption
that
defined
the
times
depeche
mode
proved
that
music
often
derided
as
simple
synth
pop
was
capable
of
the
same
expression
as
the
most
sophisticated
rock
and
even
classical
music
they
did
so
by
forcing
their
listeners
on
a
journey
inward
to
the
parts
of
ourselves
that
are
the
most
confusing
and
frightening
the
places
we
need
to
go
to
discover
what
makes
us
human
their
work
often
feels
like
an
endurance
test
how
much
pain
can
you
take?
depeche
mode
was
always
catchy
but
they
were
never
easy
their
material
touched
on
suicide
regret
obsession
doubt
and
faith
depeche
mode’s
ability
to
provoke
disparate
reactions
in
a
range
of
listeners
is
a
rare
achievement
for
a
band
that
achieved
enormous
commercial
success
most
fans
can
remember
the
first
time
they
heard
depeche
mode
me
i
was
16
and
i
went
to
visit
a
girl
who
lived
in
another
state
expecting
that
i’d
leave
with
a
new
girlfriend
we
met
at
the
beach
that
fall
and
made
out
and
danced
and
listened
to
dead
or
alive
i
spent
the
ensuing
weeks
thinking
about
her
angular
but
beautiful
nose
the
peculiar
cadence
of
her
voice
as
we
drove
around
in
her
parents’
volvo
she
told
me
that
what
amounted
to
a
weekend
fling
(and
a
chaste
one
at
that)
wasn’t
going
to
lead
to
anything
more
in
retrospect
it
seems
like
so
much
childish
bullshit
—
and
it
was
—
but
young
emotions
are
runaway
meteors
they
don’t
leave
marks
they
leave
craters
i
was
in
another
state
after
a
long
greyhound
ride
and
wanted
to
go
home
i
was
rejected
within
hours
of
arriving
and
had
to
spend
a
weekend
at
her
house
i
wasn’t
even
sure
why
i
was
invited
—
just
to
get
my
ass
kicked
to
the
curb?
the
only
music
in
her
car
as
we
drove
around
visiting
strip
malls
diners
and
a
rinkydink
zoo
was
dm’s
1984
nowclassic
some
great
reward
the
songs
were
imprinted
on
my
brain
for
life
i
will
always
associate
early
heartbreak
with
that
record
i’m
sure
i’m
not
alone
even
if
your
heart
wasn’t
broken
depeche
mode
could
make
you
feel
like
it
was
and
they
still
can
compiling
the
10
best
depeche
mode
songs
is
a
herculean
task
the
band’s
songs
open
small
alice
in
wonderlandesque
portals
that
allow
us
to
see
the
larger
often
mystifying
worlds
inside
the
hard
work
is
distilling
personal
favorites
—
songs
that
feel
eerily
autobiographical
—
from
the
best
work
in
their
long
career
particularly
when
there
are
so
few
duds
while
“blasphemous
rumors”
and
“a
question
of
lust”
receive
ample
playtime
on
my
stereo
they
don’t
reach
to
the
level
of
the
10
songs
below
as
blasphemous
as
it
may
seem
to
dissect
such
an
impressive
catalog
—
one
that
continues
to
expand
not
to
mention
inspire
new
renditions
and
remixes
—
here
are
the
10
best
songs
from
some
of
the
most
gifted
songwriters
of
our
generation
depeche
mode
was
arguably
at
their
creative
peak
from
roughly
1983
to
wilder’s
departure
in
the
mid’90s
so
while
the
band
continues
to
make
memorable
music
—
they’re
releasing
a
new
album
next
year
and
the
preview
track
suggests
good
things
—
all
of
these
songs
are
culled
from
the
band’s
pivotal
works
playing
the
angel
and
exciter
have
their
strong
moments
but
it’s
hard
to
compete
with
some
great
reward
violator
and
songs
of
faith
and
devotion
but
that’s
just
my
opinion
let’s
hear
yours
in
the
comments
10
“fly
on
the
windscreen”
from
black
celebration
(1986)
“fly
on
the
windscreen”
is
one
of
the
best
songs
on
an
album
largely
about
death
the
death
of
relationships
the
decay
of
the
physical
body
the
death
and
perhaps
rebirth
of
the
ego
the
song
could
be
about
the
abrupt
end
of
love
the
subconscious
desire
to
hold
on
to
love
no
matter
what
“reminding
us
we
could
be
torn
apart
tonight”
for
those
who
paid
attention
in
high
school
english
class
there’s
an
overt
emily
dickinson
nod
(“i
heard
a
fly
buzz
when
i
died”)
at
its
core
the
song
is
about
the
small
things
we
notice
when
everything
falls
apart
the
keyboard
—
often
an
object
of
whimsy
in
’80s
pop
—
is
dark
overwhelming
and
depressing
particularly
the
driving
hook
that
powers
the
song
the
pitchblack
tone
and
feel
of
black
celebration
birthed
more
darkness
nine
inch
nails’
pretty
hate
machine
skinny
puppy’s
mind
the
perpetual
intercourse
and
marilyn
manson
who
covered
the
next
song
on
the
list
9
“personal
jesus”
from
violator
(1990)
“reach
out
and
touch
faith”
after
the
darkness
of
depeche
mode’s
’80s
output
this
seemed
like
a
breather
even
if
some
of
the
songs
on
violator
such
as
“clean”
were
unrelentingly
dark
“jesus”
was
one
of
the
band’s
biggest
chart
successes
and
was
tweaked
and
remixed
on
dance
floors
throughout
the
early
’90s
while
rhythm
has
always
been
central
to
depeche
mode’s
songs
on
“personal
jesus”
it
was
the
song
—
one
idea
that’s
so
good
it
can
be
retooled
and
recycled
and
still
sound
fresh
as
techno
took
over
the
early
’90s
—
driving
suburban
kids
to
raves
and
ecstasy
—
depeche
mode
was
perhaps
unknowingly
one
of
the
bands
leading
the
way
8
“just
can’t
get
enough”
from
speak
and
spell
(1981)
depeche
mode’s
first
album
before
martin
gore
took
over
songwriting
duties
was
brighter
(and
less
sophisticated)
than
their
later
material
you
couldn’t
say
it
was
poppier
the
darker
work
commanded
just
as
many
replays
speak
and
spell
was
the
only
dm
record
to
feature
vince
clarke
(later
of
erasure)
there
are
a
few
diehards
who
abandoned
the
band
with
him
even
though
the
martin
gore
material
is
superior
of
the
entire
batch
“just
can’t
get
enough”
is
one
of
their
most
enduring
songs
about
slipping
and
sliding
and
falling
in
love
the
song
marked
the
band’s
last
embrace
of
childhood
innocence
before
their
moody
adolescence
and
eventual
maturity
7
“i
feel
you”
from
songs
of
faith
and
devotion
(1993)
“this
is
the
story
of
our
love”
gahan
sings
in
one
of
the
most
inspired
vocal
performances
in
a
career
that’s
like
a
highlight
reel
gahan’s
vocals
are
so
intimate
that
you
feel
like
he’s
singing
in
your
living
room
listen
for
the
brilliant
fills
in
the
small
spaces
between
the
vocals
there’s
a
musical
sophistication
here
that
you’ll
miss
if
you
focus
on
the
voice
one
youtube
commenter
says
it
all
“if
i
hadn’t
already
been
in
my
panties
this
song
would
have
made
me
take
all
my
clothes
off”
6
“people
are
people”
from
some
great
reward
(1984)
on
an
album
about
personal
struggles
this
is
a
clarion
call
for
something
that
everyone
can
get
behind
harmony
while
there
is
a
certain
hokeyness
to
“people
are
people”
this
is
a
depeche
mode
staple
the
band’s
synthpop
version
of
utopian
songs
like
“all
you
need
is
love”
it’s
also
one
of
the
few
depeche
mode
songs
to
look
consciously
outward
rather
than
to
the
interior
struggles
of
the
mind
5
“master
and
servant”
from
some
great
reward
(1984)
writing
about
sadomasochism
wasn’t
unprecedented
in
’80s
synth
pop
marc
almond
and
soft
cell
(of
“tainted
love”
fame)
crawled
deep
into
redlight
territory
on
the
1981
album
nonstop
erotic
cabaret
their
“sex
dwarf”
is
a
dirty
ditty
about
a
perv
who
carries
a
dwarf
around
on
a
dog
leash
for
sexual
thrills
depeche
mode
also
toyed
with
themes
of
pain
and
domination
“master
and
servant”
with
talk
of
forgotten
equality
and
play
between
the
sheets
is
perhaps
more
timid
than
soft
cell’s
earlier
ribald
tale
but
it
nonetheless
reached
many
more
listeners
the
chorus
of
“let’s
play
master
and
servant”
sounds
compelling
decades
later
4
“everything
counts”
from
construction
time
again
(1983)
“everything
counts”
is
an
acidic
song
that’s
all
about
joining
the
machine
written
as
depeche
mode
was
becoming
an
unstoppable
force
in
that
machine
a
band
that
filled
arenas
is
it
about
the
dirty
record
industry
or
the
band
feeling
guilty
about
having
achieved
success?
the
sacrifices
we
all
make
to
cobble
together
a
living?
is
it
telling
us
to
mind
our
time
because
we
don’t
have
much
left?
perhaps
it’s
about
all
the
above
the
band
parroted
and
mimicked
sounds
of
industry
to
give
the
song
a
feeling
of
being
swallowed
much
like
the
workers
in
fritz
lang’s
silentfilm
masterpiece
metropolis
“everything
counts”
is
the
moment
where
depeche
mode
showed
how
much
they
had
grown
after
they
were
reconfigured
following
clarke’s
departure
and
alan
wilder’s
addition
3
“stripped”
from
black
celebration
(1986)
“stripped”
earns
its
title
it’s
trimmed
and
reduced
to
its
essence
there’s
a
mechanical
backbeat
that
sounds
like
a
car
engine
rumbling
or
an
assembly
line
running
gahan’s
voice
starts
at
a
nearwhisper
and
rises
to
a
looming
rich
baritone
keyboards
sputter
to
life
a
minute
in
is
“stripped”
a
reference
to
how
much
you
can
take
away
from
a
song
and
still
have
something
memorable
as
much
as
it
is
about
reducing
someone
to
the
place
of
ultimate
vulnerability?
“stripped”
was
covered
by
the
theatrical
german
metal
band
rammstein
performed
with
a
leer
rather
than
depeche
mode’s
pensive
glare
2
“never
let
me
down
again”
from
music
for
the
masses
(1987)
depeche
mode
has
always
been
a
pop
band
with
a
proclivity
for
writing
songs
that
burrow
in
your
brain
on
“never
let
me
down
again”
they
do
the
same
with
orchestral
ambitions
this
is
in
many
ways
their
richest
song
a
songwriting
showcase
buttressed
by
a
widerranging
sound
and
approach
much
like
brian
wilson
and
the
beach
boys
did
with
“good
vibrations”
depeche
mode
constructed
a
“pocket
symphony”
tailormade
for
radio
that
contained
worlds
underneath
the
easily
grasped
the
hook
was
unexpectedly
sampled
by
the
early
white
rap
duo
3rd
bass
in
“wordz
of
wizdom
part
2”
until
then
i
never
expected
to
hear
depeche
mode
and
the
line
“these
hoes
go
frontin’
on
my
jimmy”
in
the
same
song
but
it’s
pretty
brilliant
1
“enjoy
the
silence”
from
violator
(1990)
if
any
one
song
perfectly
combines
the
elements
that
make
depeche
mode
compulsively
listenable
it’s
their
masterpiece
“enjoy
the
silence”
what
works
here?
everything
the
anthemic
chorus
gahan’s
vocals
the
wideranging
orchestral
feel
and
rich
dynamics
which
play
with
volume
and
pace
in
a
catalog
that
often
talks
about
the
pain
and
desperation
of
loneliness
the
band
seems
to
find
a
measure
of
peace
in
letting
go
and
living
in
a
quiet
moment
with
someone
important
“enjoy
the
silence”
also
marked
that
rare
moment
when
a
band’s
popularity
coincided
with
their
peak
of
their
songwriting
powers
which
somewhat
diminished
during
gahan’s
addiction
and
the
dark
years
that
followed
this
is
a
timeless
song
that
works
for
the
same
reasons
the
best
songs
by
the
beatles
and
the
rolling
stones
work
everything
is
done
right
all
at
once
it’s
pure
magic

it’s
strange
that

picking
10
dm
songs
is
basically
impossible–they’ve
never
made
a
bad
album
across
30
years
and
they
have
roughly
57
singles
released
to
date–but
this
list
isn’t
far
from
mine
i
still
remember
the
first
time
i
(actively)
heard
depeche
mode
i
was
way
into
mtv
when
i
was
10
years
old
watching
everything
from
everyone
whatever
came
my
way
a
long
saturday
morning
session
suddenly
got
interesting
when
the
new
depeche
mode
vid
lit
up
the
screen–there
was
a
guy
in
a
crown
marching
through
the
snow
across
mountains
and
everywhere
else
a
red
flower
on
a
black
backdrop
flickered
into
the
frame
while
he
sang
about
words
like
violence
it
was
the
best
song
i
had
ever
heard
then
and
it’s
still
one
of
my
favorites
today
“enjoy
the
silence”
is
the
only
choice
for
#1
as
far
as
i’m
concerned

i
would
have
“never
let
me
down
again”
as
one
and
probably
exchange
policy
of
truth
for
enjoy
the
silence
(but
have
it
lower)
i
also
like
“walking
in
my
shoes”
more
than
“i
feel
you”
and
for
later
songs
pretty
much
“it’s
no
good”
reasonable
list!
teenage
me
would
have
put
“tonight”
but
i
predict
a
lot
of
teenage
others
would
have
had
“somebody”

as
a
complete
sucker
for
anything
depeche
mode
does
i
have
to
admire
the
effort
here
i
probably
could
not
list
their
10
best
songs
and
not
feel
guilty
for
excluding
this
or
that
we
probably
all
agree
on
enjoy
the
silence
but
i’m
far
less
certain
about
people
are
people
and
just
can’t
get
enough
which
seem
a
bit
like
obvious
commercial

ick
not
even
through
the
list
but
glaring
issues
with
black
celebration…industrial
music
was
already
well
into
it’s
existence
by
then
the
skinny
puppy
album
mentioned
(my
favorite
by
them)
has
nothing
to
do
with
black
celebration
at
all
and
as
an
ex
goth
kid
from
the
80s
i
and
many
others
found
this
album
to
be
the
“playing
dress
up”
version
of
goth
and
darkness
i
think
fly
on
the
windscreen
is
hokey
lame
boring
and
completely
unimaginative
as
is
much
of
that
album
they
just
lifted
what
other
bands
were
already
doing
well
then
diluted
it
down
there
are
exceptions
stripped
new
dress
great
tracks
but
this
one
and
the
title
track—way
overrated

i
think
fly
on
the
windscreen
is
the
only
song
on
this
list
that
deserves
placement
(the
bass
groove
blends
soooo
well
into
anything
with
a
similar
bpm!)
but
that
aside
this
list
is
wildly
misinformed

i’m

fan
but
people

is
and
always
will
be
an
festering
pile
of
shit
just
an
awful
song
that
oozes
obsolescence
and
was
probably
regretted
the
minute
it
was
recorded
just
can’t

well
if
we’re
gonna
get
real
geeky
these
would
have
to
be
my
personal
picks
for
dm
favorites
(in
no
particular
order)…and
these
would
really
cut
in
quite
deep
if
you
ask
me
1
the
landscape
is
changing
(construction
time
again
1983)
2
get
the
balance
right
(1983
i
believe)
3
everything
counts
(construction
time
again
1983)
4
lie
to
me
(some
great
reward
1984)
5
somebody
(rmx)
(original
some
great
reward
1984)
6
if
you
want
(some
great
reward
1984)
7
shake
the
disease
(catching
up
with
depeche
mode
1985)
8
fly
on
the
windscreen
(even
though
the
bc
final
version
has
a
darker
tone
i
prefer
the
original
one
on
catching
up
with
depeche
mode
1985)
9
stripped
(black
celebration
1986)
10
here
is
the
house
(black
celebration
1986)
11
nothing
(music
for
the
masses
1987)
12
world

eyes
(violator
1990)
13

1990)

19

20
the
love
thieves
(ultra
1997)
21
it’s
no
good
(ultra
1997)
i’ll
be
quite
honest
i
feel
really
shitty
trying
to
dissect
a
discography
so
intense
and
complex
where
i
practically
like
nearly
every
song
in
the
catalog
(fuck
even
if
i’m
not
so
crazy
about
“speak
and
spell
(1981)
i
do
dig
“boys
say
go!”
and
“any
second
now
(voices)”)
but
i
would
say
that
these
would
make
up
an
“immediate
but
not
definitive”
list…and
i
haven’t
gotten
into
the
postwilder
stage
or
even
the
bsides
(“dangerous”…oh
my
god!!!!)
i’m
sure
i
speak
for
most
when
i
confess
that
dm
is
like
the
only
band
that’s
ever
struck
not
one
nerve
but
many
nerves
and
sensations
like
no
other
band
has
ever
done
to
me
it
fills
me
with
pride
to
know
that
still
today
dm
is
one
of
the
greatest
bands
that
has
their
imminent
place
in
the
world
of
music
can’t
wait
for
their
new
album!!!
