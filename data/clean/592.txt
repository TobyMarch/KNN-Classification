all
you
need

and
what's
good
about
this
album!
^_^
now
for
the
bad
part
if
i
fell
off
of
a
5
story
building
and
bangged
the
side
of
my
head
on
a
steel
pole
with
barbed
wire
over
it
it
would
still
be
better
than
listening
to
this
another
crappy
album
that
isn't
good
for
anything
doesn't
even
deserve
a
1
star
if
this
is
hip
hop's
future
i
swear
i
will
switch
to
bluegrass
right
now
i'd
rather
listen
to
cher
and
old
dirty
bastard
sing
over
screetching
violins
and
banging
trash
cans
than
this
and
that's
saying
something

yo
head
like
oh
this
is
tight
but
uhh
if
you
pay
attention
the
rappin
is
garbage
they
use
the
same
rhymes
through
out
the
whole
cd
and
arguably
the
same
beat
through
out
the
cd
i
just
play
it
when
i
feel
like
bobbin
my
head
and
hearin
some
tight
beats
i
mean
honestly
i
burned
it
but
i
would
recommend
buyin
it
if
you
like
crunk
stuff
such
as
lil
jon
lil
scrappy
and
all
that
best
songs
fight
white
tee
bi**h
ni**as
45's
choppas
oh
i
think
dey
like
me
the
other
ones
is
koo
oh
yea
and
like
in
all
my
reviews
don't
forget
the
tupac
cd
peace!!!!!
