with
the
song
drift
away
has
died
the
news
came
on
the
evening
of
dec
6
via
his
official
website
although
no
cause
of
death
was
listed
he
was
71
born
near
houston
in
1940
to
a
family
of
sharecroppers
gray
whose
real
name
has
been
listed
as
leonard
victor
ainsworth
and
laurence
darrow
brown
discovered
gospel
music
through
his
grandfather
a
baptist
minister
he
moved
to
los
angeles
in
the
early
1960s
where
he
met
sonny
bono
who
dubbed
him
dobie
gray
after
the
then
popular
sitcom
the
many
loves
of
dobie
gillis
gray
saw
his
first
music
industry
success
in
1965
with
the
single
the
'in'
crowd
which
reached
no
13
on
the
charts
but
it
was
1973's
countrysoul
drift
away
whose
chorus
pined
i
wanna
get
lost
in
your
rock
and
roll
and
drift
away
that
would
make
him
a
radio
staple
for
decades
to
come
the
song
was
covered
by
scores
of
musicians
including
roy
orbison
rod
stewart
waylon
jennings
ray
charles
and
michael
bolton
but
perhaps
the
most
famous
contemporary
version
was
by
detroit
rocker
uncle
kracker
in
2003
a
collaboration
with
gray
it
reached
no
9
on
the
billboard
hot
100
and
topped
the
adult
contemporary
chart
for
a
recordsetting
28
weeks
asked
about
the
song's
inclusion
on
his
album
no
stranger
to
shame
kracker
said
in
2003
this
is
a
song
that's
almost
impossible
to
do
better
than
the
original
so
i
just
grabbed
the
guy
that
did
it
originally
and
had
him
cosing
it
i
learned
[from
him]
that
you
can
be
an
older
musician
and
not
be
bitter
i
meet
a
lot
of
older
musicians
that
are
bitter
about
everything
he's
definitely
a
nice
gentleman
and
he's
very
down
to
earth
soon
after
news
broke
of
his
death
kracker
tweeted
my
heart
goes
out
to
dobie's
family
this
evening
rip
