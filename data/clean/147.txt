we
had
waited
close
to
five
years
for
the

to

needless

this
was
a
memorable
moment
for
us
we
never
had
any
expectations
for
how
the

would
be
received
we
just
wanted
to
present
our
music
as
an

to
anyone
who
would
be
open

hearing
it
it
was
incredible

the
longawaited
fourth
album
from
new

s
interpol
finds
them
exploring
dark
musical
landscapes
of
layered
depth
and
intensity
in
contrast
to
2007
s
our
love
to
admire
this
selftitled
opus
hangs
together
as
an
album
a
set
of
very
different
songs
that
thematically
connect
from
the
highly
melodic
barricade
and
lights
through
the
snarling
memory
serves
and
the
extraordinary
triptych
of
connected
tracks
that
close
the
album
interpol
have
never
made
work
this
emotionally
resonant
or
packed
with
crescendos
mixer
alan

has
brought
the
rhythm
section
back
to
the
fore
anchoring
a
thicket
of
orchestral
sound
that
brings
to
mind
touchstones
from
black
metal
to
70s
art
rock

always
remains
identifiably

cd
i'm
pretty
cynical
about
music
fans
who
protest
that
their
favourite
band's
album
is
a
grower
that
needs
ten
or
so
listens
to
fully
get
for
me
grower
often
means
this
album's
bad
but
the
fans
won't
admit
it
and
after
listening
to
this
album
a
couple
of
times
and
just
not
getting
into
it
i
felt
my
fellow
interpol
fans
were
in
denial
again
i
actually
had
my
two
star
they've
blown
it
review
ready
to
go
but
i
didn't
want
to
give
up
on
interpol
and
it
did
take
a
while
for
me
to
get
olta
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
few
more
spins
and
then
something
just
clicked
i'd
catch
myself
humming
and
singing
songs
i'd
dismissed
as
boring
or
generic
and
i
suddenly
got
where
those
experimental
tracks
were
coming
from
believe
the
fans
'interpol'
is
a
true
grower
easy
to
dismiss
as
mediocre
or
unfocussed
on
first
listen
but
it
will
reward
you
if
you
put
the
work
in
first
things
first
what's
the
album
sound
like?
we
heard
comments
that
it
would
be
a
return
to
the
sound
of
'bright
lights'
and
others
that
it
would
be
full
of
orchestral
epics
even
more
ambitious
than
'our
love'
the
answer
is
that
it's
a
bit
of
both
and
this
is
where
the
grower
part
comes
in
'interpol'
is
as
dark
and
difficult
as
their
debut
but
it's
dressed
up
in
the
same
heavy
production
and
instrumentation
that
characterised
olta
so
whereas
'bright
lights'
was
raw
and
intimate
'interpol'
requires
a
fair
effort
to
dig
out
those
riffs
melodies
and
hooks
don't
be
fooled
by
'barricade'
into
thinking
this
is
full
of
radiofriendly
pop
gems
there's
very
little
here
that
is
instantly
accessible
or
an
easy
listen
'interpol'
basically
follows
the
formula
of
olta
by
having
half
the
songs
follow
the
standard
interpol
sound
and
half
pushing
in
ambitious
new
directions
in
fact
it
sometimes
sounds
like
two
different
albums
since
all
the
boundarypushing
songs
come
toward
the
end
of
the
album
in
the
first
half
'barricade'
is
an
obvious
single
even
more
poppy
than
'heinrich
maneuver'
and
really
the
only
immediate
song
on
the
album
the
guitardriven
slowbuild
of
'lights'
and
the
more
familiar
'success'
and
'summer
well'
will
reveal
their
secrets
more
gradually
give
the
first
half
a
few
spins
and
you'll
realise
these
are
four
strong
memorable
interpol
songs
'success'
in
particular
i'd
initially
thought
was
a
very
mediocre
song
and
weak
opener
now
it's
one
of
my
alltime
favourite
interpol
tracks
it's
that
sort
of
album
the
second
half
is
much
more
daring
with
those
keyboards
and
strings
really
kicking
in
only
'safe
without'
is
recognisably
interpol
and
even
that
is
given
hints
of
funk
even
hiphop
with
that
tribal
backing
drumbeat
and
hypnotic
guitar
riff
fans
seem
to
dislike
this
song
but
for
me
it's
one
of
the
album's
highlights
'the
undoing'
is
another
favourite
an
epic
hymnlike
closer
with
mournful
minor
key
organ
brass
and
spanish
lyrics
'all
of
the
ways'
reminds
me
a
lot
of
'the
lighthouse'
with
its
sheets
of
shimmering
guitars
while
'try
it
on'
is
driven
by
a
spiralling
piano
riff
and
burbling
background
electronics
it's
a
decidedly
uninterpol
sound
but
for
the
most
part
the
band
pulls
it
off
again
you
need
to
put
in
some
serious
listening
but
those
who
liked
'wrecking
ball'
or
'the
lighthouse'
will
appreciate
the
band
continuing
to
branch
out
and
try
new
things
(and
generally
succeeding)
it's
not
a
perfect
album
fans
seem
to
be
raving
about
'memory
serves'
which
doesn't
do
much
for
me
but
for
the
most
part
it's
a
brave
bold
effort
from
a
band
that
many
people
have
pigeonholed
sure
everyone
wants
them
to
make
'bright
lights
2'
but
interpol
continue
to
show
how
willing
they
are
to
push
the
envelope
and
expand
their
sound
casual
listeners
and
those
expecting
an
album
full
of
'barricade'like
hits
will
probably
be
disappointed
this
is
an
album
that
will
reward
those
diehard
interpol
fans
who
are
prepared
to
give
this
the
effort
it
deserves

cd
interpol
is
not
a
band
that
grabs
you
instantly
you
have
to
spend
some
time
with
them
to
get
the
full
impact
of
their
music
their
songs
unfold
slowly
i'm
afraid
that
in
this
era
of
collective
add
no
one
will
give
this
one
the
time
it
needs
to
reveal
itself
interpol
is
not
a
collection
of
singles
it
is
a
concept
album
meant
to
be
experienced
from
beginning
to
end
in
interviews
promoting
this
album
the
band
has
said
that
this
follows
a
relationship
as
it
disintegrates
the
pleading
the
bargaining
the
anger
the
hurt

finally
acceptance
it's
all
here

it's
a
haunting

emotional
ride
listen
with
a
good
pair
of
headphones
from
beginning
to
end
multiple
times
you'll
be
rewarded

find
present
in
their
records
the
qualities
that
made
me
love
that
band
so
much
in
the
first
place

an
extremely
dark
romantism

paul
banks
striking
baritone
and
their
strong

punctual
songwritting


born
out
of
a
forced
discipline

as
drummer
greg
drudy
has
said
in
an
recent
interview

lyrics
rarely
say
something
specific
in
rock
music
and
here
its
no
different

what's
so
capturing
instead
is
this
whole
sense
of
unintentional
menace
of
enigmatic
lines
like

i've
got
two
secrets
but
i
only
told
you
one

from

success

or
those
nightmarishly
ohlala's
towards
the
end
of

memory
serves


stand
out
tracks
include

barricade



success



lights

and
(
personal
favourite
)

try
it
out

with
it's
devastating
climax

critics
may
follow
trends
but
music
fans
know
better
and
should
stick
with
this
talented
group
for
the
long
run

well
someone
must
not
have
been
happy
with
the
capitol/interpol
corporate
merger
just
one
album
the
experimental
our
love
to
admire
and
interpol
find
themselves
back
with
independent
label
matador
this
self
titled
album
with
the
exploding
gray
interpol
logo
with
a
black
background
sums
the
whole
thing
up
the
music
is
dark
and
fractured
in
short
a
return
to
form
this
is
both
good
and
bad
while
there
is
nothing
here
as
mind
blowing
as
the
lighthouse
was
on
the
previous
album
interpol's
mixture
of
joy
division/psychedelic
furs
malevolence
and
malaise
pulses
through
the
core
of
this
album
with
black
growls
like
success
and
the
sad
drone
of
always/the
man
i
am
piercing
through
the
murk
alan
moulder
did
these
mixes
which
reflects
his
expertise
in
making
bleakness
sound
alluring
with
guitars
sounding
like
they're
blaring
from
the
back
of
an
auditorium
and
making
things
bass
heavy
that
approach
works
even
better
on
the
uptempo
barricade
building
the
song
to
its
final
punch
overall
the
knockouts
are
not
as
consistent
as
they
were
on
our
love
to
admire
but
interpol
is
more
cohesive
as
an
album
interpol
go
back
to
basics
on
this
album
and
the
payoff
is
worth
the
listen

october

2010
by
lance
vaillancourt
formataudio
cd
this
is
a
very
different
record
for
interpol
first
and
foremost
it's
a
productionoriented
album
the
crackling
gothic
guitar
harmonies
and
snappy
basslines
we've
become
familiar
with
on
previous
albums
have
taken
a
back
seat
to
methodic
ominouslylayered
arrangements
instead
we
see
the
band
relying
more
than
ever
on
a
detached
synthambiance
and
the
icy
multitracked
vocal
work
of
paul
julian
banks
to
flesh
out
the
hollow
skeleton
of
dark
rockers
that
make
up
this
album
due
to
their
overwhelming
subtlety
it's
very
easy
to
miss
how
much
time
and
energy
must
have
gone
into
arranging
the
vocals
on
this
album
(the
number
of
vocal
tracks
on
always
malaise
alone
would
be
enough
to
exhaust
freddie
mercury
himself)
but
the
minor
keys
halfsteps
and
deadpan
delivery
remain
true
to
any
of
pjb's
best
moments
what
isn't
subtlein
any
wayis
the
melange
of
album
art
rendering
a
3d
image
of
the
band's
name
being
blown
to
smithereens
by
an
unseen
force
some
might
be
inclined
to
interpret
this
as
the
band
foreshadowing
its
own
breakup
this
is
apparently
the
last
interpol
record
that
will
feature
the
band's
original
bassist
and
keyboard
player
others
might
see
it
however
as
the
band
anticipating
the
backlash
it
would
get
from
fans
in
response
the
new
direction
it
takes
after
all
there
are
still
a
hefty
amount
of
interpol
fans
out
there
who
remain
steadfast
in
waiting
for
them
to
selflessly
mimic
what
they
were
doing
eight
years
ago
on
turn
on
the
bright
lights
i
say
let
them
evolve
this
album
took
a
bold
step
forward
it
captures
all
of
the
haunting
cold
and
calculated
mystique
of
their
previous
work
and
sends
it
careening
through
space
on
a
quiet
sonic
journey
to
the
outer
limits
this
is
interpol

a
band
uncertain
of
its
future
interpol
is
a
great
band
and
certainly
capable
of
releasing
engrossing
and
energetic
music
unfortunately
this
record
doesn't
give
you
that
impression

it's
not
a
perfect
album
the
shaky
bassist
work
(departure
of
bassist
carlos
dengler)
on
some
of
the
album
is
sometimes
confusing
some
songs
rely
more
