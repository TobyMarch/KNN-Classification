there's
good
stuff
in
the
other
recommendations/replies
based
on
the
bands
you
already
enjoy
try
adding
some
muddy
waters
willie
dixon
little
walter
sonny
boy
williams
ii
and
howlin'
wolf
if
it's
the
guitar
playing
that
trips
your
switches
then
also
try
some
stevie
ray
vaughan
current
artists
like
sonny
landreth
joe
bonamassa
and
kelly
joe
phelps
might
also
rattle
your
blues
bone
you
could
also
do
a
lot
worse
than
check
out
the
rolling
stones'
exile
on
mainstreet
which
is
their
most
authentically
blues
drenched
album
oh
and
big
sky
country
by
the
late
chris
whitley
is
a
fantastcally
atmospheric
take
on
the
blues
enjoy
