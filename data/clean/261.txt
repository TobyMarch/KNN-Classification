the
last
play
at
shea
“the
last
play
at
shea”
chronicles
the
waning
days
of
shea
stadium
through
a
tapestry
of
performance
historical
documentary
and
personal
journey
through
the
prism
of
billy
joel’s
extraordinary
career
and
blue
collar
perspective
and
so
it
goes
and
every
time
i've
held
a
rose
it
seems
i
only
felt
the
thorns
and
so
it
goes
and
so
it
goes
and
so
will
you
soon
i
suppose
but
if
my
silence
made
you
leave
then
that
would
be
my
worst
mistake
so
i
will
share
this
room
with
you
and
you
can
have
this
heart
to
break

sitting

making
love
to
his
tonic

gin
he
says
son
can
you
play
me
a
memory?
i'm
not
really
sure
how
it
goes
but
it's
sad
and
it's
sweet
and

knew
it
