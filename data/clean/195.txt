nirvana
was
an
american
rock
band
formed
by
singer/guitarist
kurt
cobain
and
bassist
krist
novoselic
in
aberdeen
washington
in
1987
nirvana
went
through
a
succession
of
drummers
the
longestlasting
being
dave
grohl
who
joined
the
band
in
1990
despite
releasing
only
three
fulllength
studio
albums
in
their
sevenyear
career
nirvana
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
influential
and
important
rock
bands
of
the
modern
era[1][2]
in
the
late
1980s
nirvana
established
itself
as
part
of
the
seattle
grunge
scene
releasing
its
first
album
bleach
for
the
independent
record
label
sub
pop
in
1989
the
band
eventually
came
to
develop
a
sound
that
relied
on
dynamic
contrasts
often
between
quiet
verses
and
loud
heavy
choruses
after
signing
to
major
label
dgc
records
nirvana
found
unexpected
success
with
smells
like
teen
spirit
the
first
single
from
the
band's
second
album
nevermind
(1991)
nirvana's
sudden
success
widely
popularized
alternative
rock
as
a
whole
and
the
band's
frontman
cobain
found
himself
referred
to
in
the
media
as
the
spokesman
of
a
generation
with
nirvana
being
considered
the
flagship
band
of
generation
x[3]
nirvana's
third
and
final
studio
album
in
utero
(1993)
featured
an
abrasive
lessmainstream
sound
and
challenged
the
group's
audience
the
album
did
not
match
the
sales
figures
of
nevermind
but
was
still
a
critical
and
commercial
success
nirvana's
brief
run
ended
following
the
death
of
kurt
cobain
in
1994
but
various
posthumous
releases
have
been
issued
since
overseen
by
novoselic
grohl
and
cobain's
widow
courtney
love
since
its
debut
the
band
has
sold
over
25
million
records
in
the
united
states
alone
and
over
75
million
records
worldwide
making
them
one
of
the
bestselling
music
artists
in
history
four
of
their
albums
two
studio
and
two
live
have
reached
the
number
one
spot
on
the
billboard
200
chart
in
the
years
since
the
band's
breakup
nirvana
has
been
ranked
highly
on
several
lists
by
various
publications
as
one
of
the
greatest
artists
of
all
time
rolling
stone
described
nirvana's
influence
as
having
kicked
in
the
1990s
as
a
musical
era[4]
adding
that
their
music
guaranteed
the
nineties
would
not
suck[5]
and
claimed
that
the
band
transformed
rock
for
a
generation[6]
according
to
the
magazine
few
bands
in
rock
history
have
had
a
more
immediate
and
tangible
impact
on
their
contemporary
pop
musical
landscape
than
nirvana
did
in
the
early
nineties[7]
nirvana
is
set
to
be
inducted
into
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
in
2014
the
band's
first
year
of
eligibility
the
museum's
biography
of
the
band
states
that
nirvana
start[ed]
a
rock
revolution
and
remain
an
enduring
influence
and
challenge
before
declaring
them
proof
that
the
right
band
with
the
right
noise
can
change
the
world[8]

formation
and
early
years
[edit]
cobain
and
novoselic
met
while
attending
aberdeen
high
although
they
never
connected
according
to
cobain[9]
the
pair
eventually
became
friends
while
frequenting
the
practice
space
of
the
melvins[10]
cobain
wanted
to
form
a
band
with
novoselic
but
novoselic
did
not
respond
to
his
requests
which
included
giving
him
a
demo
tape
of
his
project
fecal
matter
three
years
after
the
two
first
met
novoselic
notified
cobain
that
he
had
finally
listened
to
the
fecal
matter
demo
cobain
had
given
him
and
suggested
they
start
a
group
the
pair
recruited
bob
mcfadden
on
drums
but
after
a
month
the
project
fell
apart[11]
in
late
1987
cobain
and
novoselic
recruited
drummer
aaron
burckhard[12]
the
three
practiced
material
from
cobain's
fecal
matter
tape
but
started
writing
new
material
soon
after
forming[13]
during
its
initial
months
the
band
went
through
a
series
of
names
starting
with
skid
row
and
including
pen
cap
chew
bliss
and
ted
ed
fred
the
group
finally
settled
on
nirvana
which
cobain
said
was
chosen
because
i
wanted
a
name
that
was
kind
of
beautiful
or
nice
and
pretty
instead
of
a
mean
raunchy
punk
name
like
the
angry
samoans[14]
with
novoselic
and
cobain
having
moved
to
tacoma
and
olympia
washington
respectively
the
two
temporarily
lost
contact
with
burckhard
the
pair
instead
practiced
with
dale
crover
of
the
melvins
and
nirvana
recorded
its
first
demos
in
january
1988[15]
in
early
1988
crover
moved
to
san
francisco
but
recommended
dave
foster
to
the
band
as
his
replacement
on
drums[16]
foster's
tenure
with
nirvana
lasted
only
a
few
months
during
a
stint
in
jail
he
was
replaced
by
a
returning
burckhard
who
himself
didn't
stay
with
the
band
after
telling
cobain
he
was
too
hung
over
to
practice
one
day[17]
cobain
and
novoselic
put
an
ad
in
seattle
music
publication
the
rocket
seeking
a
replacement
drummer
which
only
yielded
unsatisfactory
responses
meanwhile
a
mutual
friend
introduced
them
to
chad
channing
and
the
three
musicians
agreed
to
jam
together
channing
continued
to
jam
with
cobain
and
novoselic
although
the
drummer
noted
they
never
actually
said
'ok
you're
in'
and
channing
played
his
first
show
with
the
group
that

early
releases
[edit]
nirvana
released
its
first
single
love
buzz
in
november
1988
on
the
seattle
independent
record
label
sub
pop[19]
the
following
month
the
band
began
recording
its
debut
album
bleach
with
local
producer
jack
endino[20]
bleach
was
highly
influenced
by
the
heavy
dirgerock
of
the
melvins
and
mudhoney
1980s
punk
rock
and
the
1970s
heavy
metal
of
black
sabbath
novoselic
said
in
a
2001
interview
with
rolling
stone
that
the
band
had
played
a
tape
in
their
van
while
on
tour
that
had
an
album
by
the
smithereens
on
one
side
and
an
album
by
the
black
metal
band
celtic
frost
on
the
other
and
noted
that
the
combination
probably
played
an
influence
as
well[21]
the
money
for
the
recording
sessions
for
bleach
listed
as
$60617
on
the
album
sleeve
was
supplied
by
jason
everman
who
was
subsequently
brought
into
the
band
as
the
second
guitarist
though
everman
did
not
actually
play
on
the
album
he
received
a
credit
on
bleach
because
according
to
novoselic
they
wanted
to
make
him
feel
more
at
home
in
the
band[22]
just
prior
to
the
album's
release
nirvana
insisted
on
signing
an
extended
contract
with
sub
pop
making
the
band
the
first
to
do
so
with
the
label[23]
following
the
release
of
bleach
in
june
1989
nirvana
embarked
on
its
first
national
tour[24]
and
the
album
became
a
favorite
of
college
radio
stations[25]
due
to
increasing
dissatisfaction
with
everman
over
the
course
of
the
tour
nirvana
canceled
the
last
few
dates
and
drove
back
to
washington
no
one
told
everman
he
was
fired
at
the
time
while
everman
later
claimed
that
he
actually
quit
the
group[26]
although
sub
pop
did
not
promote
bleach
as
much
as
other
releases
it
was
a
steady
seller[27]
and
had
initial
sales
of
40000
copies[28]
however
cobain
was
upset
by
the
label's
lack
of
promotion
and
distribution
for
the
album[27]
in
late
1989
the
band
recorded
the
blew
ep
with
producer
steve
fisk[29]
in
a
late
1989
interview
cobain
noted
that
the
band's
music
was
changing
he
said
the
early
songs
were
really
angry

but
as
time
goes
on
the
songs
are
getting
poppier
and
poppier
as
i
get
happier
and
happier
the
songs
are
now
about
conflicts
in
relationships
emotional
things
with
other
human
beings[30]
in
april
1990
the
band
began
working
with
producer
butch
vig
at
smart
studios
in
madison
wisconsin
on
recordings
for
the
followup
to
bleach[31]
during
the
sessions
cobain
and
novoselic
became
disenchanted
with
channing's
drumming
and
channing
expressed
frustration
at
not
being
actively
involved
in
songwriting
as
bootlegs
of
nirvana's
demos
with
vig
began
to
circulate
in
the
music
industry
and
draw
attention
from
major
labels
channing
left
the
band[32]
that
july
the
band
recorded
the
single
sliver
with
mudhoney
drummer
dan
peters[33]
nirvana
asked
dale
crover
to
fill
in
on
drums
for
a
sevendate
american
west
coast
tour
with
sonic
youth
that
august[34]
in
september
1990
buzz
osborne
of
the
melvins
introduced
the
band
to
dave
grohl
who
was
looking
for
a
new
band
following
the
sudden
breakup
of
washington
dc
hardcore
punks
scream[35]
a
few
days
after
arriving
in
seattle
novoselic
and
cobain
auditioned
grohl
with
novoselic
later
stating
we
knew
in
two
minutes
that
he
was
the
right
drummer[36]
mainstream
success
[edit]
disenchanted
with
sub
pop
and
with
the
smart
studios
sessions
generating
interest
nirvana
decided
to
look
for
a
deal
with
a
major
record
label
since
no
indie
label
could
buy
the
group
out
of
its
contract[37]
following
repeated
recommendations
by
sonic
youth's
kim
gordon
nirvana
signed
to
dgc
records
in
1990[38]
the
band
subsequently
began
recording
its
first
major
label
album
nevermind
the
group
was
offered
a
number
of
producers
to
choose
from
but
ultimately
held
out
for
butch
vig[39]
rather
than
recording
at
vig's
madison
studio
as
they
had
in
1990
production
shifted
to
sound
city
studios
in
van
nuys
los
angeles
california
for
two
months
the
band
worked
through
a
variety
of
songs
in
its
catalog
some
of
the
songs
such
as
in
bloom
and
breed
had
been
in
nirvana's
repertoire
for
years
while
others
including
on
a
plain
and
stay
away
lacked
finished
lyrics
until
midway
through
the
recording
process[40]
after
the
recording
sessions
were
completed
vig
and
the
band
set
out
to
mix
the
album
however
the
recording
sessions
had
run
behind
schedule
and
the
resulting
mixes
were
deemed
unsatisfactory
slayer
mixer
andy
wallace
was
brought
in
to
create
the
final
mix
after
the
album's
release
members
of
nirvana
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
the
polished
sound
the
mixer
had
given
nevermind[41]
initially
dgc
records
was
hoping
to
sell
250000
copies
of
nevermind
which
was
the
same
level
they
had
achieved
with
sonic
youth's
goo[42]
however
the
album's
first
single
smells
like
teen
spirit
quickly
gained
momentum
thanks
in
part
to
significant
airplay
of
the
song's
music
video
on
mtv
as
it
toured
europe
during
late
1991
the
band
found
that
its
shows
were
dangerously
oversold
that
television
crews
were
becoming
a
constant
presence
onstage
and
that
smells
like
teen
spirit
was
almost
omnipresent
on
radio
and
music
television[43]
by
christmas
1991
nevermind
was
selling
400000
copies
a
week
in
the
us[44]
in
january
1992
the
album
displaced
michael
jackson's
dangerous
at
number
one
on
the
billboard
album
charts
and
also
topped
the
charts
in
numerous
other
countries[45]
the
month
nevermind
reached
number
one
billboard
proclaimed
nirvana
is
that
rare
band
that
has
everything
critical
acclaim
industry
respect
pop
radio
appeal
and
a
rocksolid
college/alternative
base[46]
the
album
would
eventually
sell
over
seven
million
copies
in
the
united
states[47]
and
over
30
million
worldwide[48]
citing
exhaustion
nirvana
decided
not
to
undertake
another
american
tour
in
support
of
nevermind
instead
opting
to
make
only
a
handful
of
performances
later
that
year[49]
in
march
1992
cobain
sought
to
reorganize
the
group's
songwriting
royalties
(which
to
this
point
had
been
split
equally)
so
that
they
were
more
representative
of
the
fact
that
he
wrote
the
majority
of
the
music
grohl
and
novoselic
did
not
object
to
cobain's
request
but
when
the
frontman
asked
for
the
agreement
to
be
retroactive
to
the
release
of
nevermind
the
disagreements
between
the
two
sides
came
close
to
breaking
up
the
band
after
a
week
of
tension
cobain
ended
up
receiving
a
retroactive
share
of
75
percent
of
the
royalties
and
bad
feelings
about
the
situation
remained
within
the
group
afterward[50]
amid
rumors
that
the
band
was
disbanding
due
to
cobain's
health
nirvana
headlined
the
closing
night
of
england's
1992
reading
festival
where
cobain
personally
programmed
the
performance
lineup[51]
nirvana's
performance
at
reading
is
often
regarded
by
the
press
as
one
of
the
most
memorable
of
the
group's
career[52][53]
a
few
days
later
nirvana
performed
at
the
mtv
video
music
awards
where
despite
the
network's
refusal
to
let
the
band
play
the
new
song
rape
me
during
the
broadcast
cobain
strummed
and
sang
the
first
few
bars
of
the
song
before
breaking
into
lithium
at
the
ceremony
the
band
received
awards
for
the
best
alternative
video
and
best
new
artist
categories[54]
dgc
had
hoped
to
have
a
new
nirvana
album
by
the
band
ready
for
a
late
1992
holiday
season
release
since
work
on
it
proceeded
slowly
the
label
released
the
compilation
album
incesticide
in
december
1992[55]
a
joint
venture
between
dgc
and
sub
pop
incesticide
collected
various
rare
nirvana
recordings
and
was
intended
to
provide
the
material
for
a
better
price
and
at
better
quality
than
was
available
via
bootleg
copies[56]
as
nevermind
had
been
out
for
15
months
and
had
yielded
a
fourth
single
in
in
bloom
by
that
point
geffen/dgc
opted
not
to
heavily
promote
incesticide
which
was
certified
gold
by
the
recording
industry
association
of
america
the
following
february[57]
in

final
months
and

death
[edit]

the
guilt
a
split
single
with
the
jesus
lizard
on
the
independent
label
touch

go[55]
meanwhile
the
group
chose
steve
albini
who
had
a
reputation
as
a
principled
and
opinionated
individual
in
the
american
indie
music
scene
to
record
its
third
album
while
there
was
speculation
that
the
band
chose
albini
to
record
the
album
due
to
his
underground
credentials[58]
cobain
insisted
that
albini's
sound
was
simply
the
one
he
had
always
wanted
nirvana
to
have
a
natural
recording
without
layers
of
studio
trickery[59]
nirvana
traveled
to
pachyderm
studio
in
cannon
falls
minnesota
in
that
february
to
record
the
album[60]
the
sessions
with
albini
were
productive
and
notably
quick
and
the
album
was
recorded
and
mixed
in
two
weeks
for
a
cost
of
$25000[61]
several
weeks
after
the
completion
of
the
recording
sessions
stories
ran
in
the
chicago
tribune
and

help
cobain
described
the
sound
of
nirvana
when
it
first
started
as
a
gang
of
four
and
scratch
acid
ripoff[56]
later
when
nirvana
recorded
bleach
cobain
felt
he
had
to
fit
the
expectations
of
the
sub
pop
grunge
sound
to
build
a
fanbase
and
hence
suppressed
his
arty
and
pop
songwriting
traits
while
crafting
the
record
in
favor
of
a
more
rocking
sound[95]
nirvana
biographer
michael
azerrad
argued
ironically
it
was
the
restrictions
of
the
sub
pop
sound
that
helped
the
band
find
its
musical
identity
azerrad
stated
that
by
acknowledging
that
its
members
had
grown
up
listening
to
black
sabbath
and
aerosmith
the
band
was
able
to
move
on
from
its
derivative
early
sound[96]
nirvana
used
dynamic
shifts
that
went
from
quiet
to
loud[64]
cobain
had
sought
to
mix
heavy
and
pop
musical
sounds
he
commented
i
wanted
to
be
totally
led
zeppelin
in
a
way
and
then
be
totally
extreme
punk
rock
and
then
do
real
wimpy
pop
songs
when
cobain
heard
the
pixies'
1988
album
surfer
rosa
after
recording
bleach
he
felt
it
had
the
sound
he
wanted
to
achieve
but
until
then
was
too
intimidated
to
try
the
pixies'
subsequent
popularity
encouraged
cobain
to
follow
his
instincts
as
a
songwriter[97]
like
the
pixies
nirvana
moved
between
spare
bassanddrum
grooves
and
shrill
bursts
of
screaming
guitar
and
vocals[98]
near
the
end
of
his
life
cobain
noted
the
band
had
become
bored
by
the
formula
finding
it
limited
but
he
expressed
doubts
that
the
band
was
skilled
enough
to
try
other
dynamics[64]
cobain's
rhythm
guitar
style
which
relied
on
power
chords
lownote
riffs
and
a
loose
righthand
technique
featured
the
key
components
to
the
bandâ€™s
songs
cobain
would
often
initially
play
a
song's
verse
riff
in
a
clean
tone
then
double
it
with
distorted
guitars
when
he
repeated
the
part
in
some
songs
the
guitar
would
be
absent
from
the
verses
entirely
to
allow
the
drums
and
bass
guitar
to
support
the
vocals
or
it
would
only
play
sparse
melodies
like
the
twonote
pattern
used
in
smells
like
teen
spirit
cobain
rarely
played
standard
guitar
solos
opting
to
play
slight
variations
of
the
song's
melody
as
single
note
lines
cobain's
solos
were
mostly
bluesbased
and
out
of
tune
which
music
writer
jon
chappell
described
as
almost
an
iconoclastic
parody
of
the
traditional
instrumental
break
a
quality
typified
by
the
notefornote
replication
of
the
lead
melody
in
smells
like
teen
spirit
and
the
atonal
solo
for
breed[94]
grohl's
drumming
took
nirvana's
sound
to
a
new
level
of
intensity[99]
azerrad
stated
that
grohl's
powerful
drumming
propelled
the
band
to
a
whole
new
plane
visually
as
well
as
musically
noting
although
dave
is
a
merciless
basher
his
parts
are
also
distinctly
musicalâ€”it
wouldn't
be
difficult
to
figure
out
what
song
he
was
playing
even
without
the
rest
of
the
music[100]
during
live
performances
cobain
and
novoselic
would
always
tune
their
guitars
to
e
flat[101]
cobain
noted
we
play
so
hard
we
can't
tune
our
guitars
fast
enough[102]
the
band
made
a
habit
of
destroying
its
equipment
after
shows
novoselic
said
he
and
cobain
created
the
shtick
in
order
to
get
off
of
the
stage
sooner[103]
cobain
stated
it
began
as
an
expression
of
his
frustration
with
chad
channing
making
mistakes
and
dropping
out
entirely
during
performances[104]

nirvana
songs
treat
the
banal
and
pedestrian
with
a
unique
slant[105]
cobain
came
up
with
the
basic
components
of
each
song
(usually
writing
them
on
an
acoustic
guitar)
as
well
as
the
singing
style
and
the
lyrics
he
emphasized
that
novoselic
and
grohl
have
a
big
part
in
deciding
on
how
long
a
song
should
be
and
how
many
parts
it
should
have
so
i
don't
like
to
be
considered
the
sole
songwriter[106]
when
asked
which
part
of
the
songs
he
would
write
first
cobain
responded
i
donâ€™t
know
i
really
donâ€™t
know
i
guess
i
start
with
the
verse
and
then
go
into
the
chorus[64]
cobain
usually
wrote
lyrics
for
songs
minutes
before
recording
them[106]
cobain
said
when
i
write
a
song
the
lyrics
are
the
least
important
subject
i
can
go
through
two
or
three
different
subjects
in
a
song
and
the
title
can
mean
absolutely
nothing
at
all[107]
cobain
told
spin
in
1993
that
he
didn't
give
a
flying
fuck
what
the
lyrics
on
bleach
were
about
figuring
let's
just
scream
some
negative
lyrics
and
as
long
as
they're
not
sexist
and
don't
get
too
embarrassing
it'll
be
okay
while
the
lyrics
to
nevermind
were
taken
from
two
years
of
poetry
he
had
accumulated
which
he
cut
up
and
chose
lines
he
preferred
from
in
comparison
cobain
stated
that
the
lyrics
to
in
utero
were
more
focused
they're
almost
built
on
themes[108]
cobain
didn't
write
necessarily
in
a
linear
fashion
instead
relying
on
juxtapositions
of
contradictory
images
to
convey
emotions
and
ideas
often
in
his
lyrics
cobain
would
present
an
idea
then
reject
it
the
songwriter
explained
i'm
such
a
nihilistic
jerk
half
the
time
and
other
times
i'm
so
vulnerable
and
sincere
