cd
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
albums
a
friend
got
me
into
this
band
a
few
months
ago
and
i
ignored
them
until
the
song
all
my
friends
came
up
on
my
shuffle
i
was
obsessed
with
it
and
hesitant
to
listen
to
the
other
six
songs
because
i
was
sure
that
they
could
not
be
as
good
as
the
one
i'd
already
heard
that
was
not
the
case
land
of
talk
is
a
straightup
garage
band
but
with
enough
pop
influence
to
be
listenable
as
all
hell
doubling
as
the
frontwoman
guitarist
liz
powell
gives
the
band
an
energy
that's
impossible
to
ignore
even
on
the
downtempo
tracks
there's
a
gritty
sweetness
to
her
voice
that
captivates
there's
no
way
to
describe
this
album
adequately
to
someone
who
hasn't
heard
it
get
it
as
soon
as
you
can

that's

it

usually
have
a

this

just
stays
in

rotation

i
find
it
deeper
with

go

i
was
really
happy
with
this
album
i
insisted
on
actually
buying
a
physical
copy
(a
cd!)
because
it
was
just
that
good
it's
not
the
greatest
recording
but
the
guitar
work
is
really
riffy
and
borders
on
a
slightlyoutoftune
sound



in
the
coolest
way
possible!

you're
looking
for
a
good

indie

cd
i
saw
land
of
talk
by
accident
because
they
opened
for
the
stills
in
san
francisco
unfortunately
i
showed
up
near
the
end
of
their
set
but
the
three
and
a
half
songs
i
heard
was
enough
to
get
me
hooked
i
bought
the
album
and
i
am
still
impressed
their
sound
and
energy
reminds
me
of
the
blake
babies
at
their
early
gritty
best
only
seven
tracks
on
this
album
but
they
are
all
good
(listen
to
three
of
them
on
their
myspace
page)
and
i'm
looking
forward
to
future
us
shows
and
a
full
