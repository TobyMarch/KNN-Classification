musically
not
much
they
started
out
as
the
jefferson
airplane
and
had
a
pretty
female
lead
singer
with
a
foghorn
voice
named
grace
slick
she
wrote
some
potent
vengeful
sounding
songs
like
white
rabbit
and
two
heads
white
rabbit
was
a
drugoriented
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
and
became
a
classic
hit
it
remains
by
the
best
thing
they
have
done
when
grace
is
not
singing
the
band
is
mediocre
at
best
with
cluttered
sounds
and
not
much
punch
they
were
hugely
popular
but
had
no
lasting
effect
on
the
musical
scene
