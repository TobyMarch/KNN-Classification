biography
gary
allan
herzberg
(born
december
5
1967)
is
an
american
country
music
artist
known
professionally
as
gary
allan
allan
was
born
and
raised
in
la
mirada
california
to
harley
and
mary
herzberg
to
ensure
that
the
family
would
focus
on
music
allan’s
mother
insisted
that
the
family’s
guitars
would
always
remain
visible
in
the
home
at
age
thirteen
allan
began
playing
in
honky
tonks
with
his
father
two
years
later
he
was
offered
his
first
recording
contract
from
am
records
but
rejected
the
deal
his
parents
wanted
him
to
finish
his
education
and
his
father
felt
that
allan
had
yet
to
develop
his
own
distinctive
style
despite
his
commitment
to
finishing
school
allan
reflects
that
he
was
rarely
alert
in
class
“i
played
the
bars
at
night
i
was
half
asleep
when
i
got
to
school
i
thought
sleep
was
what
you
did
when
you
got
to
school”
after
finishing
school
he
continued
to
play
in
the
bars
with
his
band
the
honky
tonk
wranglers
many
of
the
venues
they
played
were
packed
and
promoters
often
tried
to
move
them
to
larger
clubs
the
moves
would
have
required
him
to
stop
playing
some
of
the
older
country
music
such
as
covers
of
george
jones
songs
so
allan
refused
allan
was
introduced
to
songwriter/producer
byron
hill
on
august
28
1993
by
a
mutual
friend
and
talentscout
jim
seal
at
a
bar
called
the
lion
d’or
in
downey
california
where
allan
was
already
regularly
performing
