review
for

performance
at
the
2011
manchester
international
festival
bernadette
mcnulty
of
the
daily
telegraph
commented
on
her
voice
and
music
the
45yearold
still
uses
electronic
dance
beats
with
a
fullblooded
raver’s
passion
and
the
elemental
timbre
of
her
voice
has
grown
more
powerful
with
age[64]
in
late
2012
it
was
reported
that
bj&oumlrk
had
undergone
surgery
for
a
polyp
on
her
vocal
cords
commenting
on
the
success
of
the
procedure
after
years
of
maintaining
a
strict
diet
and
utilising
vocal
exercises
to
prevent
vocal
injury
she
stated
i
have
to
say
in
my
case
anyway
surgery
rocks!
continuing
on
i
stayed
quiet
for
three
weeks
and
then
started
singing
and
definitely
feel
like
my
cords
are
as
good
as
prenodule
it's
been
very
satisfying
to
sing
all
them
clear
notes
again[65]
however
in
a
review
for
biophilia
kitty
empire
of
the

stated
that
presurgery
bj&oumlrk
still
sounded
strong
commenting
that
her
voice
was
spectacular
and
swooping
particularly
on
the
song
thunderbolt[66]
in
a
similar
vein
matthew
cole
of
slant
magazine
adds
that
her
voice
has
been
preserved
quite
well
however
he
also
stipulates
that
her
onceformidable
wail
is
too
hoarse
and
shouty
to
be
the
ace
in
the
hole
that
it
once
was
also
adding
it's
only
where
her
most
dramatic
vocal
pyrotechnics
are
concerned
that
there's
any
question
of
physical
ability[67]

unique
even
if
i
gave

$3
million
you
couldn't
improve
on
it
[its]
simplicity

debut
solo

bj&oumlrk
citied
as
one
of
her
favourite
recent
new
acts
of
the
last
few
years
during
a
radio
interview
and
encouraged
one
little

paparazzi
and
controversy
[edit]
bj&oumlrk
has
complained
of
being
hounded
by
paparazzi
in
1996
bj&oumlrk
arrived
at
bangkok
international
airport
with
her
son
sindri
after
a
long
haul
flight
when
julie
kaufman
a
female
reporter
greeted
bj&oumlrk
with
welcome
to
bangkok
which
was
then
followed
by
bj&oumlrk's
attacking
her
and
knocking
her
to
the
ground
bj&oumlrk
has
said
that
the
reason
for
the
attack
was
that
the
reporters
in
the
airport
started
talking
to
her
son
saying
such
things
as
it
must
be
hard
to
be
the
son
of
a
pop
star
bj&oumlrk's
record
company
also
said
that
the
reporter
had
been
pestering
bj&oumlrk
for
four
days
bj&oumlrk
later
apologized
to
kaufman
who
declined
to
involve
the
police
the
incident
would
appear
on
the
trutv
series
trutv
presents
world's
dumbest
on
13
january
2008
bj&oumlrk
attacked
a
photographer
who
had
photographed
her
arrival
at
auckland
international
airport
in
new
zealand
for
her
scheduled
performance
at
the
big
day
out
festival[82]
bj&oumlrk
allegedly
tore
the
photographer's
shirt
down
the
back
and
in
the
process
she
fell
to
the
ground[83]
neither
the
photographer
nor
his
employer
the
new
zealand
herald
lodged
a
formal
complaint
and
auckland
police
did
not
investigate
further[84]
political
views
[edit]
bj&oumlrk's
years
in
kukl
aligned
her
with
the
anarchist
crass
collective[85]
while
she
has
since
been
hesitant
to
be
seen
as
an
overtly
political
figure
and
has
said
so
on
her
website[86]
she
is
strongly
supportive
of
numerous
liberation
movements
across
the
globe
including
support
for
independence
for
kosovo[87]
she
dedicated
her
song
declare
independence
to
greenland
and
the
faroe
islands
which
caused
a
minor
controversy
in
the
faroes
when
bj&oumlrk
twice
dedicated
declare
independence
to
the
people
of
kosovo
during
a
concert
in
japan[88]
a
planned
performance
of
hers
was
cancelled
at
serbia's
exit
festival
reportedly
due
to
safety
concerns
in
2008
bj&oumlrk
set
off
an
international
controversy
after
she
dedicated
declare
independence
to
the
tibet
freedom
movement
during
a
shanghai
concert
chanting
tibet!
tibet!
during
the
song
china's
culture
ministry
issued
a
denunciation
through
state
news
agency
xinhua
stating
that
bj&oumlrk
broke
chinese
law
and
hurt
chinese
people's
feelings
and
pledged
to
further
tighten
control
over
foreign
artists
performing
in
china
a
later
statement
accused
bj&oumlrk
of
whipping
up
ethnic
hatred[89]
sexuality
[edit]
in
an
interview
with
diva
magazine
in
october
2004
she
said
i
think
everyone's
bisexual
to
some
degree
or
another
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
you
choose
to
recognize
it
and
embrace
it
personally
i
think
choosing
between
men
and
women
is
like
choosing
between
cake
and
ice
cream
you'd
be
daft
not
to
try
both
when
there
are
so
many
different
flavors[90]
bj&oumlrk
has
accumulated
a
large
gay
fanbase
over
the
years
in
an
interview
with
instinct
magazine
in
2004
she
acknowledged
it
saying
i
like
to
think
of
people
who
buy
my
records
as
equals
don't
think
of
them
as
gay
or
black
or
young
or
old
they're
just
people
who
enjoy
my
music
i've
had
so
many
close
gay
friends
all
my
life
it's
not
that
big
of
a
deal
with
me
but
i'd
be
lying
if
i
said
there
weren't
things
i
find
easier
to
talk
about
with
gay
guys[91]
