following
the
format's
breakup
in
2008
frontman
nate
ruess
took
his
songwriting
skills
to
steel
train's
jack
antonoff
and
anathallo's
andrew
dost
both
of
whom
shared
a
similar
affinity
for
vintage
pop
music
and
quirky
melodic
hooks
the
trio
began
a
series
of
collaborations
in
antonoff's
parents'
living
room
and
soon
enlisted
the
help
of
producer
steven
mcdonald
who
recorded
their
work
and
handled
bass
duties
after
enlisting
the
help
of
former
jellyfish
keyboardist
robert
joseph
manning
jr
who
arranged
several
tracks
the
bandmates
completed
work
on
their
first
record
dubbing
themselves
fun
the
group
introduced
their
queen
and
eloinfluenced
big
pop
sound
in
2009
with
the
debut
album
aim
and
ignite
in
2012
fun
returned
with
its
sophomore
effort
some
nights
the
album
was
produced
by
jeff
bhasker
who
worked
on
kanye
west's
my
beautiful
dark
twisted
fantasy
the
album
drew
much
inspiration
from
hiphop
and
west
in
particular
while
staying
true
to
their
roots
and
blowing
their
sound
up
to
impressively
large
proportions
the
record's
first
single
we
are
young
featured
vocals
by
janelle
mon&aacutee
and
reached
number
three
on
