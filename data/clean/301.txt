creedence
clearwater
revival
distinguished
themselves
in
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
through
these
contradictions
this
sixdisc
set
is
the
definitive
creedence
collection
offering
superbly
remastered
versions
of
all
of
their
studio
and
live
albums
and
adding
a
disc's
worth
of
precreedence
material
the
ultimate
bluecollar
rock
band
john
fogerty
and
ccr
found
success
by
wholly
giving
in
to
their
fascination
with
the
american
south
(despite
hailing
from
northern
california)
and
exploring
the
turf
that
connected
rb
and
countrythe
same
turf
that
their
heroes
at
sun
studios
tilled
at
rock's
birth
as
the
songs
on
the
first
disc
prove
they
hadn't
always
taken
this
approach
though
perhaps
they
should
have
the
first
four
songs
from
1961
(by
tommy
fogerty
and
the
blue
velvets)
original
compositions
in
the
classic
'50s
rock

roll
style
they
loved
hold
up
better
than
subsequent
golliwogs
tracks
that
attempt
to
replicate
the
british
invasion
sound
in
vogue
at
the
time
still
the
golliwogs
tracks
offer
hints
of
john
fogerty's
menacing
growl
and
biting
guitar
that
would
fully
blossom
later
on
when
diving
into
ccr's
entire
body
of
work
many
myths
dissipate
and
a
more
wellrounded
view
comes
into
focus
the
quintessential
singles
band
that
dominated
am
radio
was
also
quite
an
album
band
releasing
solid
records
from
top
to
bottom
even
though
half
of
the
songs
were
saturating
radio
long
before
the
lp
would
hit
also
they
weren't
quite
as
far
removed
from
their
bay
area
brethren
(who
were
reared
on
the
same
roots
music)
as
is
often
stated
offering
a
number
of
long
and
loose
jams
that
while
not
overtly
psychedelic
gave
them
and
their
fans
a
chance
to
stretch
out
without
question
though
ccr
were
the
kings
of
the
threeminute

exploration

necessarily
reveal
that

their
glorious

to
emanate
straight
from
the
murky
swamps
of

smoky

fierce

the
big
difference
between
this
edition
of
the
ccr
box
and
its
acclaimed
2001
predecessor
is
its
sleeker
highly
attractive
packaging
the
artwork
highlights
the

strong
affinity
for
kustom

in
all
their
naugahydecovered

paying
clever
tribute
to
ccr

gritty
garage
rock
roots
in
the
process
its

cd
maybe
you're
looking
at
this
boxed
set
of
ccr
cds
wondering
if
you
should
buy
it
or
instead
focus
on
the
greatest
hits
cds
or
maybe
you're
thinking
of
purchasing
all
of
the
individual
albums
in
the
form
of
the
remastered
cds
that
were
released
in
2000
(or
if
you're
like
me
you
already
did)
i'll
make
the
decision
easy
for
you
buy
this
box
you'll
end
up
a
lot
happier
in
the
long
run
here's
why
creedence
clearwater
revival
officially
released
7
studio
albums
and
2
live
albums
of
those
9
albums
8
are
exceptional
8
classic
albums
that
rock
rattle
and
roll
8
albums
that
have
no
filler
8
albums
that
you'll
enjoy
listening
to
repeatedly
if
you're
a
rock
and
roll
enthusiast
(the
ninth
album
mardi
gras
was
the
last
ccr
studio
album
and
is
neither
up
to
the
standards
set
by
the
other
8
albums
nor
is
it
the
worst
album
ever
released
by
a
major
band
as
originally
reviewed
by
rolling
stone
magazine
the
worst
i
can
say
about
it
is
that
it's
average)
don't
bother
with
the
greatest
hits
cds
there's
too
much
good
stuff
left
out
for
example
`ramble
tamble'
off
of
cosmo's
factory
and
`effigy'
from
willy
and
the
poor
boys
are
only
two
of
the
classic
ccr
tracks
that
don't
appear
on
the
compilation
cds
they're
just
as
good
as
proud
mary
bad
moon
rising
or
any
of
the
other
hit
singles
(the
first
time
i
heard
`ramble
tamble'
i
couldn't
believe
my
ears)
even
though
ccr
is
considered
a
singles
band
their
albums
are
amazingly
cohesive
listening
to
each
album
in
its
entirety
and
in
the
original
order
makes
for
a
more
pleasurable
experience
you
could
buy
all
of
the
remastered
albums
on
cd
but
that's
a
bad
choice
for
a
few
reasons
1
live
in
europe
has
yet
to
be
released
in
remastered
form
on
cd
(as
of
november
2001)
and
the
original
cd
sounds
horrible
you'll
get
a
remastered
version
only
in
this
boxed
set
2
the
rarities
all
of
disc
1
of
this
boxed
set
is
devoted
to
tracks
from
the
golliwogs
and
tommy
fogerty
and
the
blue
velvets
while
not
all
of
these
tracks
are
up
to
the
quality
of
the
later
ccr
stuff
most
of
it's
great
rock
and
roll
also
you
won't
get
parts
1
and
2
of
45
revolutions
per
minute
outside
of
this
set
3
the
price
even
though
this
boxed
set
is
a
bit
pricey
you'll
still
save
over
buying
the
complete
set
of
remastered
cds
so
what's
so
great
about
this
set?
first
you're
getting
everything
(and
i
do
mean
everything)
in
order
on
6
cds
the
precreedence
stuff
comes
first
then
all
of
the
albums
in
their
original
order
and
all
of
the
tracks
come
just
as
they
did
on
the
original
albums
everything's
remastered
and
sounds
terrific
the
two
live
sets
are
full
of
energy
the
booklet
contains
many
great
essays
and
many
great
pictures
honestly
even
without
the
unreleased
stuff
this
set
is
exceptional
just
having
everything
creedence
in
one
spot
sounding
so
crisp
and
full
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
bottom
line
if
you
don't
have
a
complete
ccr
collection
already
and
can
spare
the
money
buy
this
set
you'll
end
up
wanting
it
in
the
long
run
so
you
might
as
well
make
things
easy
on
yourself
and
just
start
here

they�ve

better
july

2003
by
david
a
bede
formataudio
cd
ccr
is
high
on
the
list
of
bands
that
made
me
glad
i
saved
all
my
old
records
as
was
the
case
with
most
bands
from
the
precd
era
the
first
cd
reissues
of
their
albums
had
sound
quality
that
seemed
thin
enough
to
tear
so
you
were
better
off
with
the
pops
and
skips
on
the
original
vinyl
that
finally
changed
a
few
years
ago
with
the
remastered
versions
of
all
their
albums
and
this
collection
features
all
of
those
(including
liner
notes
and
pictures)
plus
a
bit
more
with
nearly
every
note
the
four
guys
from
el
cerrito
are
known
to
have
recorded
under
their
various
band
names
from
19611972
this
is
about
as
close
to
a
complete
collection
as
we're
ever
likely
to
get
(the
infamous
lost
1962
single
of
yes
you
did
and
now
you're
not
mine
is
still
lost
but
everything
else
appears
to
be
here)
so
unless
you
bought
all
the
remastered
cds
individually
this
collection
is
well
worth
the
price
tag
to
any
serious
fan
creedence
was
all
but
unique
among
singlesoriented
bands
in
that
most
of
their
album
cuts
have
aged
just
as
well
as
their
hits
and
it
shows
here
if
anything
relatively
obscure
songs
like
wrote
a
song
for
everyone
and
ramble
tamble
sound
fresher
than
proud
mary
and
some
of
the
other
classics
which
oldies
and
classic
rock
stations
have
done
their
best
to
play
into
the
ground
even
the
muchmaligned
mardi
gras
album
proves
not
to
be
the
disaster
it
was
once
made
out
to
be
(although
it
is
still
their
weakest
link)
stu
cook's
door
to
door
actually
rocks
pretty
convincingly
and
most
of
the
other
selections
have
their
moments
as
well
one
word
of
advice
if
you're
thinking
about
buying
this
collection
only
for
the
preccr
songs
i
wouldn't
recommend
it
some
of
the
early
sides
are
quite
good
(you
better
be
careful
and
fight
fire
would
have
sounded
at
home
on
their
first
album)
and
even
the
weaker
efforts
are
an
interesting
look
at
the
roots
of
one
of
rock's
all
time
greatest
bands
but
bottom
line
there
is
a
reason
why
they
didn't
become
famous
until
1968
but
if
there
are
any
other
holes
in
your
collection
this
is
the
perfect
addition
to
it

the

of

short
lived

may

by
ed
hanley
formataudio
cd
the
creedence
clearwater
revival
box
set
is
very
much
a
mammoth
enterprise
in
its
own
right
containing
all
seven
original
albums
and
two
live
albums
not
to
mention
a
whole
disc
full
of
material
from
their
stints
as
tommy
fogerty

the
blue
velvets
and
the
golliwogs
this
is
very
much
a
unique
offer
all
tracks
have
been
superbly
remastered
thus
salvaging
their
legacy
for
forthcoming
generations
once
you
possess
this
set
you
need
not
even
browse
through
the
other
compilations
since
all
of
it
is
here
and
a
little
bit
more
the
undoubted
highlight
of
the
set
is
the
first
disc
focusing
on
the
precreedence
period
the
blue
velvets
singles
make
their
debut
appearance
here
(the
most
devout
creedence
fan
may
have
noticed
that
the
third
single
is
absent
because
of
its
scarcity)
the
golliwogs
singles
made
their
first
appearance
on
vinyl
on
the
1975
pre
creedence
compilation
which
also
included
the
first
single
under
the
name
of
creedence
clearwater
revival
to
top
it
all
off
there
are
even
extra
tracks
among
the
singles
that
prior
to
this
set
never
saw
the
light
of
day
i
only
met
you
just
an
hour
ago
she
was
mine
gonna
hang
around
instrumental
#1
little
tina
and
try
try
try
which
in
all
sound
a
lot
different
compared
to
the
blue
velvets
material
which
harked
back
to
'50s
style
rock'n'roll
another
additional
treat
is
the
abandoned
single
tell
me/you
can't
be
true
(second
version)
that
was
never
released
the
disc
finishes
off
with
an
action
usa
radio
promotional
spot
the
bside
of
the
first
creedence
single
porterville
call
it
pretending
opens
disc
2
which
up
to
disc
5
focuses
on
the
original
creedence
albums
until
reaching
tracks
3
and
4
on
disc
5
probably
the
rarest
of
gems
in
the
creedence
catalog
45
revolutions
per
minute
(parts
12)
was
originally
a
promo
disc
recorded
in
late
1970
and
distributed
to
radio
stations
it
is
basically
a
group
interview
interspersed
with
added
effects
(not
to
mention
a
very
amusing
sequence
where
john
fogerty
can
be
heard
speaking
backwards!)
and
musical
backdrops
to
boot
this
particular
track
is
as
yet
not
available
elsewhere
the
remainder
of
disc
5
and
the
sixth
(and
last)
one
display
mardi
gras
plus
the
two
live
albums
in
concert
and
live
in
europe
(with
additional
tracks
apparently
taken
from
live
in
germany
which
was
recorded
at
the
same
time
period
as
live
in
europe)
along
with
the
discs
is
a
full
booklet
with
extensive
liner
notes
and
a
review
for
each
album
by
various
writers
and
chroniclers
the
early
years
(by
alec
palao)
especially
makes
for
very
interesting
reading
with
additional
input
from
stu
cook
and
doug
clifford
discussing
the
olden
days
the
only
major
shame
is
that
john
fogerty
did
not
contribute
to
the
reminiscences
one
could
assume
(given
the
current
situation
between
him
and
the
others)
that
he
was
not
very
much
interested
in
their
early
history
simply
by
reading
the
booklet
it
could
easily
evoke
memories
of
a
bygone
era
especially
among
those
who
grew
up
listening
to
creedence
in
the
late
'60s
without
doubt
one
of
the
best
and
most
significant
bands
america
could
ever
boost
therefore
this
box
set
is
a
milestone
on
behalf
of
their
enduring
legacy
which
ever
continues
to
inspire
and
beguile
thousands
or
even
millions
wherever
creedence
is
known
played
and
loved
hats
off
to
ccr!
