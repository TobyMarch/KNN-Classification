sometimes
the
road
to
a
hit
single
starts
with
a
drink
to
calm
the
nerves
a
year
ago
nate
ruess
the
frontman
of
the
poprock
trio
fun
was
anxious
about
meeting
jeff
bhasker
the
producer
and
hit
maker
behind
artists
including
kanye
west
and
beyonc&eacute
so
he
arrived
early
at
the
bar
in
the
bowery
hotel
on
the
lower
east
side
“and
had
a
little
to
drink
just
to
make
sure
i
was
loosened
up”

the
core
members
of

in

andrew
dost
nate
ruess
and
jack
antonoff
mr
bhasker
who
had
just
finished
a
long
day
in
the
studio
with
beyonc&eacute
had
already
canceled
two
meetings
with
mr
ruess
he
said
he
had
decided
to
give
mr
ruess
a
30yearold
songwriter
from
phoenix
just
10
minutes
but
the
two
started
talking
about
music
and
mr
bhasker
became
intrigued
by
mr
ruess’s
desire
to
merge
hiphop
beats
and
electronic
effects
with
his
theatrical
poprock
reminiscent
of
1970s
bands
like
queen
and
electric
light
orchestra
mr
bhasker
invited
mr
ruess
to
his
room
to
hear
some
beyonc&eacute
tracks
he
had
been
working
on
slightly
tipsy
and
feeling
inspired
mr
ruess
belted
out
the
chorus
for
“we
are
young”
an
unfinished
song
that
had
been
rattling
around
his
head
“i
was
kind
of
blown
away”
mr
bhasker
recalled
“he
sings
me
the
song
and
i
immediately
booked
a
studio
for
the
next
day”
the
song
they
recorded
that
week
eventually
became
a
breakout
hit
that
topped
the
billboard
hot
100
chart
this
week
and
has
sold
more
than
12
million
digital
copies
it
anchors
fun’s
second
album
“some
nights”
which
made
its
debut
last
week
at
no
3
on
the
billboard
album
chart
and
remains
at
no
12
this
week
having
sold
95000
copies
those
numbers
represent
a
remarkable
success
for
this
new
yorkbased
indie
group
its
first
album
“aim
and
ignite”
(nettwerk
2009)
has
sold
only
75000
copies
and
has
never
climbed
above
no
71
on
the
album
chart
the
spike
in
popularity
is
even
more
rare
for
an
alternative
rock
outfit
it
has
been
more
than
a
decade
since
a
rock
band
had
a
song
enter
the
pop
chart
in
the
top
spot
(nickelback
did
it
in
december
2001
with
“how
you
remind
me”)
billboard
put
fun
(yes
it’s
spelled
with
a
period)
on
its
cover
this
week
the
song
has
also
been
gaining
airplay
on
independent
stations
in
recent
weeks
“it
doesn’t
sound
like
anything
else
on
the
radio
—
it’s
fresh”
said
bruce
warren
the
assistant
station
manager
for
wxpn
(885
fm)
in
philadelphia
“at
the
same
time
though
it
has
almost
immediate
familiarity
obviously
the
harmonies
bring
to
mind
a
band
like
queen
so
there’s
a
touch
point
for
older
listeners”
the
success
of
“we
are
young”
which
features
janelle
mon&aacutee
as
a
guest
vocalist
owes
something
to
a
couple
of
marketing
coups
for
its
record
label
fueled
by
ramen
last
year
the
producers
of
fox’s
“glee”
decided
to
cover
the
song
even
though
it
had
not
yet
been
released
and
the
show
generally
avoids
songs
by
new
bands
before
they
become
famous
tracey
raftery
a
“glee”
spokeswoman
said
then
chevrolet
used
it
in
a
commercial
shown
during
the
super
bowl
and
the
single
soared
selling
301000
copies
last
week
alone
mr
ruess
has
a
knack
for
writing
grandiose
pop
tunes
with
complex
structures
soaring
hooks
and
pensive
verses
during
a
creative
dry
spell
in
late
2010
he
began
to
pester
the
head
of
his
label
john
janick
about
working
with
mr
bhasker
he
had
become
fascinated
with
mr
bhasker’s
experimental
hiphop
tracks
on
drake’s
“thank
me
later”
and
kanye
west’s
“my
beautiful
dark
twisted
fantasy”
“i
started
falling
in
love
with
the
drake
album
and
the
kanye
album
and
i
thought
that’s
really
theatrical
and
it’s
hiphop
music
and
i
make
really
theatrical
music”
mr
ruess
said
“why
can’t
i
add
a
hiphop
element?”
he
said
his
idea
was
“to
take
that
’70s
songwriting
style
but
modernize
it
a
little
bit
more”
musically
mr
bhasker
pushed
mr
ruess
and
his
band
mates
—
the
guitarist
jack
antonoff
and
the
keyboardist
andrew
dost
—
to
use
a
more
lush
sonic
palette
with
heavier
rhythmic
underpinnings
than
they
had
on
their
previous
album
which&nbspwas
produced
by
steven
mcdonald
mr
bhasker
layered
mr
ruess’s
crystalline
tenor
upon
itself
like
“a
freddie
mercury
choir”
in
mr
bhasker’s
words
and
sometimes
altered
the
singer’s
voice
with
autotune
the
pitchcorrection
device
to
give
it
a
robotic
sound
several
tracks
feature
the
ominously
low
synthesizer
parts
mr
bhasker
is
known
for
unlike
the
group’s
previous
album
this
one
has
drum
tracks
that
are
completely
synthetic
but
rich
propulsive
and
booming
with
very
few
cymbals
echoing
peter
gabriel’s
work
mr
bhasker
mixed
in
odd
strains
of
exotic
instruments
on
some
tracks
like
irish
drums
and
whistles
on
the
lilting
“carry
on”
mr
ruess’s
lyrics
give
the
album
a
troubling
and
introspective
edge
“we
are
young”
starts
out
with
a
confused
fumbling
apology
in
a
bar
—
a
young
man
trying
to
atone
to
someone
for
a
mysterious
past
offense
—
before
breaking
into
an
anthemic
chorus
about
being
young
another
song
“it
gets
better”
relates
an
unromantic
scene
in
which
a
girl
loses
her
virginity
the
title
track
expresses
the
existential
angst
of
a
young
man
a
long
way
from
home
and
includes
lines
like
my
heart
is
breaking
for
my
sister
and
the
con
that
she
called
love
and
when
i
look
into
my
nephew’s
eyes
man
you
wouldn’t
believe
the
most
amazing
things
that
can
come
from
some
terrible
nights
“he
can
tackle
these
really
dark
subjects
and
put
this
pop
melody
to
it”
mr
bhasker
said
mr
ruess
said
he
moved
to
new
york
and
formed
the
trio
in
2008
after
the
breakup
of
his
phoenixbased
band
the
format
he
recruited
mr
antonoff
who
had
been
a
guitarist
with
steel
train
and
mr
dost
who
played
keyboards
for
anathallo
they
had
all
had
a
modicum
of
success
in
the
indiepop
world
but
never
broke
into
the
ranks
of
the
bigearning
acts
fun
is
a
secondchance
band
mr
ruess
said
and
the
members
never
expected
it
to
be
a
commercial
success
mr
ruess
who
lists
fleetwood
mac
and
van
morrison
among
his
favorites
said
he
did
not
want
to
revive
the
’70s
poprock
sound
so
much
as
reinvent
it
“i
remember
george
harrison
once
said
elo
is
what
the
beatles
would
have
sounded
like
if
they
had
kept
going”
he
said
referring
to
electric
light
orchestra
“i
think
that
’70s
classic
music
—
if
it
had
continued
to
go
—
that
this
is
what
it
would
sound
like”
