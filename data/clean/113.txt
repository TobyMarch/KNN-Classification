the
classic
debut
november
19
2005
by
daniel
maltzman
formataudio
cd
when
one
looks
back
at
the
alternative
rock
scene
that
dominated
the
first
half
of
the
90s
garbage's
selftitled
debut
album
immediately
comes
to
mind
as
a
defining
album
from
that
movement
a
decade
old
as
of
this
writing
garbage
(1995)
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
not
only
contains
some
of
the
best
singles
from
the
90s
but
is
a
modernday
classic
garbage
has
many
elements
in
its
sound
which
can
explain
its
broad
appeal
the
songs
are
so
incredibly
infectious
and
danceable
fans
of
dancepop
(madonna
janet
jackson)
are
sure
to
enjoy
the
album
but
garbage
is
undeniably
a
rock
album
first
and
foremost
with
crunching
guitars
intense
drumming
and
a
charismatic
frontwoman
a
more
rock
inclined
audience
is
sure
to
dig
garbage
as
well
garbage's
music
also
encompasses
an
element
of
70s/80s
cool
newwave
in
a
sense
garbage
was
like
an
updated
version
of
blondie
for
the
1990s
so
fans
yearning
for
a
new
debbie
harry
are
sure
to
appreciate
garbage
another
reason
garbage
struck
such
a
chord
with
the
public
is
there
really
wasn't
another
band
quite
like
them
there
were
bands
that
were
precursors
to
garbage
like
curve
and
my
bloody
valentine
among
others
but
they
didn't
take
off
and
explode
as
garbage
did
for
whatever
reason
probably
due
to
marketing
and
timing
garbage's
debut
came
out
at
the
perfect
time
in
an
era
of
postgrunge
where
many
upandcoming
bands
were
clearly
derivative
of
nirvana
and
pearl
jam
garbage's
brand
of
rock/pop/retro
offered
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
while
garbage's
cynical
themes
fit
the
disparaging
alt
rock
90s
like
a
glove
the
lyrics
are
often
tongueincheek
in
this
sense
garbage
had
the
best
of
both
worlds
cynical
lyrics
for
cynical
times
but
with
the
playful
sexy
trimmings
of
blondie
because
the
musicians
of
garbage
butch
vig
(drums)
steve
marker
(guitar)
and
duke
erickson
(guitar)
were
made
up
of
firstrate
producers
namely
butch
vig
they
knew
how
to
craft
songs
meticulously
and
methodically
they
also
happened
to
be
great
songwriters'
toboot
great
songwriters
and
producers'
aside
the
band
still
needed
the
perfect
singerenter
shirley
manson
while
working
on
songs
for
their
new
band
vig
marker
and
erickson
spotted
the
scotchborn
shirley
manson
on
mtv
at
the
time
manson
was
the
lead
singer
for
(the
underrated)
angelfish
knowing
manson
would
be
the
perfect
singer
the
band
sent
out
the
word
and
a
short
time
later
manson
joined
the
group
thus
garbage
was
born
it's
one
thing
to
have
great
songs
and
producers
but
the
perfect
singer
is
needed
to
put
a
face
on
the
music
and
the
image
truth
be
told
garbage
without
manson
would
have
been
like
van
halen
without
david
lee
roth
without
manson
garbage
most
likely
would
have
been
a
good
but
untimely
forgettable
band
a
footnote
in
the
90s
while
the
songs
on
garbage
are
excellent
no
doubt
it
is
manson
that
truly
makes
them
shine
truly
a
gifted
singer
she
can
change
from
sounding
sensitive
to
indifferent
seductive
to
vengeful
passionate
to
passive
all
in
a
single
breath
while
her
beautiful
voice
can
enchant
it
can
also
scorn
much
like
nico
before
her
manson
is
a
true
femme
fatale
manson
proved
to
be
very
popular
with
males
and
females
alike
her
selfconfidence
integrity
and
selfempowerment
no
doubt
struck
a
chord
with
a
female
audience
being
extremely
attractive
a
femme
fatale
a
sort
of
black
widow
was
no
doubt
appealing
to
men
garbage's
unique
brand
of
electronic
pop/rock
is
demonstrated
immediately
with
the
seductive
supervixen
manson
sounds
as
though
she
gets
sadistic
pleasure
as
she
plays
with
the
listener
telling
her
audience
to
bow
down
to
me
the
offbeat
queer
is
equally
seductive
and
quite
mesmerizing
leaving
a
lasting
impression
the
album's
massive
hit
the
super
infectious
only
happy
when
it
rains
is
without
doubt
one
of
the
greatest
rock
songs
from
the
1990s
it
both
epitomizes
and
mocks
the
selfinvolvement
and
narcissism
of
generation
x
if
manson
had
toyed
with
the
listener
up
to
this
point
she
now
shows
her
teeth
with
the
aggressive
as
heaven
is
wide
with
its
almost
black
sabbathlike
riff
with
electronic
trimmings
it
makes
for
an
intriguing
and
captivating
listen
the
goodbutnotgreat
not
my
idea
is
cut
from
the
same
cloth
and
keeps
up
the
momentum
the
somewhat
spacey
stroke
of
luck
shows
traces
of
both
beauty
and
darkness
as
manson
lets
her
guard
down
as
she
sings
did
you
know
i
was
lost
until
you
found
me
one
of
the
catchiest
most
memorable
songs
on
the
album
the
vindictive
vow
is
both
unforgiving
and
seductive
an
ode
to
female
empowerment
manson
shows
her
contempt
for
the
dimwitted
in
stupid
girl
the
hardrocking
but
danceable
dog
new
tricks
keeps
the
album
moving
along
garbage
saves
some
of
its
best
songs
for
last
and
demonstrates
its
mastery
of
popcraft
with
the
lush
my
lovers
box
and
fix
me
like
most
garbage
albums
the
selftitled
debut
ends
on
a
morose
note
with
the
cheerless
milk
which
leaves
a
lasting
feeling
ten
years
old
garbage's
selftitled
debut
album
has
aged
well
and
sounds
as
good
today
as
it
did
back
in
'95
garbage
stands
as
one
of
the
finest
albums
from
the
1990s
and
is
an
essential
cornerstone
to
add
to
any
modern
rock
collection
people
unfamiliar
with
garbage
are
best
served
starting
off
here
with
the
selftitled
debut
but
garbage
is
no
onealbumwonder
band
and
people
who
like
what
they
hear
here
are
advised
to
buy
version
20
(1998)
beautiful

(2001)
and

what
can
i
say
about
this
album?
it's
the
brilliant
debut
from
the
best
band
to
ever
grace
earth
with
its
presence
garbage
if
you're
not
a
really
hardcore
garbage
fan
you
should
buy
the
us
release
of
garbage
but
if
you
are
reading
this
and
are
contemplating
spending
the
money
to
get
a
copy
of
subhuman
(garbage's
first
ever
songas
far
as
i
know)
do
it!
subhuman
is
a
brilliant
song
dark
biting
sharp
and
extremely
catchy
this
japanese
version
of
garbage
also
contains
#1
crushthe
same
version
as
on
the
romeo
and
juliet
soundtrack
so
if
you're
buying
this
thinking
you'll
be
getting
the
original
version
of
#1
crush
you're
mistaken
you'll
probably
have
to
search
for
the
extremely
rare
vinyl
single
of
subhuman
anyways
subhuman
isn't
the
only
good
thing
about
this
album
it's
packed
with
13
other
tracks
ranging
from
a
gloomy
introspective
kind
of
feel
in
stroke
of
luck
to
confident
and
cocky
selfproclamation
in
supervixen
(the
best
track
in
my
opinion
well
buy
it!
it's
worth
it

cd
i
came
to
this
album
only
very
late
in
the
game
and
i
have
to
say
better
late
than
never
i
knew
garbage
by
reputation
a
reputation
that
was
strengthened
when
i
agreed
to
take
into
my
home
two
completely
black
cats
sisters
named
tori
(after
tori
amos)
and
shirley
(after
shirley
manson)
finally
to
learn
more
about
my
kitty's
namesake
i
gave
this
album
a
try
and
i
was
absolutely
shocked
at
how
great
it
is
the
amazing
thing
about
this
album
is
that
on
the
surface
it
is
almost
a
punk
album
with
a
tough
exterior
hard
driving
rhythms
edgy
production
and
extraordinary
arrangements
but
somehow
partly
because
of
the
stunningly
musical
nature
of
each
cut
and
partly
because
of
the
breathy
almost
girlish
quality
of
the
vocals
by
my
cat's
namesake
the
songs
comes
across
as
more
pop
than
alternative
there
really
isn't
a
bad
cut
on
the
album
and
several
of
them
are
quite
exceptional
the
album
begins
on
a
strong
note
with
the
rasping
gritty
supervixen
before
moving
into
the
spectacular
queer

which
is
one
of
the
greatest
songs
on
the
album
it
proceeds
on
to
such
marvelous
pop
masterpieces
as
i'm
only
happy
when
it
rains
and
vow
not
all
of
the
songs
are
as
good
as
they
appear
to
be
not
my
idea
for
instance
is
a
decent
song
that
is
made
memorable
by
stunning
arrangement
the
care
and
crafting
that
goes
into
every
song
is
remarkable
in
this
way
i'm
still
not
certain
that
i
would
have
been
inspired
to
name
my
cat
after
shirley
manson
had
i
gotten
her
as
a
kitten
but
i
am
now
definitely
a
fan
of
the
band
this
is
one
those
discs
that
is
going
to
spin
significant
time
in
the
future
in
my
cd
player

cd
this
album
still
gets
high
rotation
in
my
cd
player
7+
years
after
its
release
it's
an
incredibly
unique
cd
that
captured
my
attention
when
it
came
out
garbage
is
comprised
of
shirley
manson
(vocals
guitar)
duke
erikson
(guitars
keyboards
etc)
steve
marker
(guitar
bass
etc)
butch
vig
(drums
efx
etc)
this
is
one
of
the
more
innovative
and
original
debut
albums
i
have
heard
a
pretty
influencial
album
if
you
ask
me
there's
a
mix
of
everything
here
this
is
by
far
their
darkest
album
there's
lots
of
grungy
type
guitars
but
they
also
manage
to
encorporate
different
noises
you'll
probably
hear
different
sounds
each
time
you
turn
on
the
cd
shirley's
vocals
are
captivating
haunting
at
one
minute
next
she
is
seductive
there
is
not
one
bad
song
on
this
album
as
one
reviewer
pointed
out
each
song
could
have
stood
on
its
own
as
a
single
my
personal
favorite
is
the
closing
track
milk
a
high
note
to
end
the
album
on
very
haunting
melody
and
lyrics
supervixen
has
a
unique
start/stop
sound
to
it
the
album
actually
has
a
lot
of
lyrics
that
i
think
a
lot
of
people
could
relate
to
about
feeling
different
from
everyone
else
queer
is
a
good
example
only
happy
when
it
rains
is
a
fairly
depressing
song
that
works
itself
into
an
anthem
this
cd
works
on
a
lot
of
levels
worth
many
many
many
repeated
listenings
one
of
the
best
bands
to
come
out
on
the
90s
in
my
opinion
give
this
one
a
shot
it's
a
great
cd
