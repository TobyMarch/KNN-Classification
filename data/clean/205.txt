biography
athens
georgia
united
states
(1997
–
present)
of
montreal
is
an
indie
pop
band
which
formed
in
athens
georgia
united
states
in
1997
the
band
is
fronted
by
kevin
barnes
who
writes
composes
and
plays
most
of
the
music
for
his
albums
they
were
among
the
second
wave
of
groups
to
emerge
from
the
elephant
6
recording
company
and
the
group
has
a
style
that
is
typical
of
many
elephant
6
bands
due
to
their
interest
in
combining
musical
experimentation
with
the
basic
tenets
of
pop
ie
catchy
melodies
and
singalong
choruses
the
band’s
style
has
been
influenced
by
conventional
indie
pop
psychedelic
music
vaudeville
and
music
hall
on
their
earlier
releases
and
by
afrobeat
funk
krautrock
and
reggae
on
their
recent
releases
the
band’s
style
has
been
known
to
change
between
albums
at
first
the
band
embraced
a
more
simple
quirky
lofi
indie
pop
sound
which
occasionally
bordered
on
twee
pop
the
band
was
created
by
kevin
barnes
and
named
after
a
failed
romance
with
a
woman
from
montreal
though
the
story
changes
in
various
interviews
barnes
was
the
only
member
of
the
“group”
prior
to
his
relocation
to
athens
georgia
there
he
met
derek
almstead
later
of
circulatory
system
m
coast
elf
power
etc
and
bryan
poole
who
also
performs
as
the
late
bp
helium
together
they
recorded
their
first
album
cherry
peel
as
well
as
the
bird
who
continues
to
eat
the
rabbit’s
flower
and
the
bedside
drama
a
petite
tragedy

paralytic
stalks
is
the
one
that
seems
hardest
to
get
at
least
based
on
the
reviews
i
like
it
a
lot
it
was
the
fourth
record
of
kevin's
i
ever
listened
to
now
to
not
get
skeletal
lamping
is
pretty
weird
that's
a
very
highlyregarded
one
i
think
the
hardest
thing
about
skeletal
lamping
is
that
absolutely
none
of
the
tracks
are
sensibly
named
i
know
kevin's
position
on
that
i
read
or
heard
it
once
he
says
something
like
i
think
if
you're
creating
something
why
stop
the
creative
process
when
it
comes
to
the
name
you
should
name
it
something
creative
as
well
if
you
want
it's
hard
for
me
to
remember
which
song
is
which
and
what
the
songs
even
are
though
haha
especially
on
skeletal
lamping
