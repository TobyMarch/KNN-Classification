digable

deliberately
disavowed
the
toughness
of
hiphop
culture
the
trio's
leader
called
himself
butterfly
his
foil
ladybug
purred
like
eartha
kitt
and
they
produced
hooks
out
of
lines
like
we're
just
babies
man
despite
occasional
flashes
of
sorrow
(like
the
prochoice
recitation
la
femme
f&eacutetal)
the
group's
happy
and
laidback
on
this
debut
with
tracks
made
out
of
old
jazz
records
and
fingersnaps
and
words
that
draw
on
50s
hipster
slang
reachin'
spawned
the
grammywinning
single
rebirth
of
slick
(cool
like
dat)
and
after
this
album
their
joyous
blue

lost

jimmy's
digging
this
october

mike
formataudio
cd
digable
planets
came
off
as
a
flash
in
the
pan
in
the
pages
of
hip
hop
history
which
is
a
crying
shame
considering
that
this
debut
album
of
theirs
is
so
good
that
it
deserves
a
lot
more
respect
than
it's
getting
sylk
130
for
starters
produces
some
of
the
best
jazzheavy
beats
of
the
early
90s
making
it
a
truly
uplifting
feelgood
album
despite
the
politicallycharged
nature
of
the
lyrics
the
mcs
are
also
off
the
hook
and
in
my
opinion
brutally
slepton
this
album
dropped
in
1993
around
when
illmatic
and
midnight
marauders
dropped
both
of
these
albums
are
heralded
as
lyrical
masterpieces
yet
i
feel
that
reachin'
belongs
right
up
there
next
to
nas
and
q
tip
butter
doodle
and
mecca
have
a
smooth
yet
airtight
approach
to
the
microphone
and
their
lyrics
are
both
entertaining
and
socially
relavent
while
these
cats
flew
under
the
radar
mostly
due
to
their
ultraleft
political
alignment
i
do
believe
that
the
digable
planets
deserve
the
same
credit
groups
like
a
tribe
called
quest
are
getting
the
digable
planets
produced
a
more
positive
and
empowering
message
than
any
group
could
ever
even
hope
to
achieve

an
achievement
that
only
the
likes
of
krsone
could
ever
boast
while
de
la
soul
and
a
tribe
called
quest
kept
our
summer
days
that
much
cooler
with
three
feet
high
and
rising
and
low
end
theory
digable
planets
were
doing
the
same
thing
yet
at
the
same
time
spreading
a
message
that
was
so
important
to
the
black
communities
of
new
york
in
the
early
90s
don't
get
me
wrong
i
think
that
most
of
the
socalled
daisy
hip
hop
acts
brought
a
truly
positive
vibe
to
people's
earphones
and
i
love
them
for
that
but
digable
planets
were
on
a
whole
other
level
the
passion
that
came
out
of
their
two
albums
was
like
no
other
for
me
groups
like
tribe
were
about
straight
cold
chilling
digable
planets
however
were
about
straight
inspiration
and
empowerment

cd
i've
recently
started
listening
to
this
(tape)
about
a
week
ago
after
a
long
time
and
then
wonder
what
took
me
so
long
to
dig
the
bad
boy
back
up
like
a
tribe
called
quest's
low
end
theory
reachin'
is
another
album
that
you
can
play
all
the
way
through
this
album
is
just
as
smooth
and
jazzy
as
the
best
of
sade
with
a
hip
hop
feel
to
it
man
i
long
for
jazzy
hip
hop
to
be
the
mainstream
in
pop
music
as
long
as
no
one
loses
their
touch
maybe
it
will
happen
we
everyone
tires
of
the
hip
hop
that's
out
now
my
favorite
track
are
'jimmi
diggin'
cats'
'femme
fatale'
'nickel
bags'
and
the
popular
'rebirth
of
slick'
where
are
bands
like
digable
planets
arrested
development
and
public
enemy
when
you
need
them

digable
planets
released
reachin'
(a
new
refutation
of
time
and
space)
in
1993
to
great
success
the
cd
went
gold
as
did
their
first
single
rebirth
of
slick
(cool
like
dat)
which
peaked
at
#15
on
the
top
100
the
song
was
a
huge
breakthrough

it
didn't
sound
like
anything
else
on
the
radio
they
even
received
a
grammy
nomination
for
best
new
artist
losing
to
toni
braxton
and
rebirth
of
slick
won
best
rap
group
single
beating
out
arrested
development
and
naughty
by
nature
among
others
it's
a
terrific
song
although
it's
lost
some
of
its
luster
over
the
years
from
overexposure
including
a
tackling
by
the
american
idol
finalists
on
a
recent
episode
their
music
is
heavy
on
jazz
samples
including
art
blakey
steven
bernstein
and
eddie
harris
a
few
of
the
samples
come
from
the
legendary
blue
note
label
which
makes
digable
planet's
concept
and
sound
somewhat
similar
to
us3
(cantaloop)
however
digable
planet
overlaid
these
samples
with
very
laidback
raps
exactly
what
you'd
expect
from
a
band
with
members
named
butterfly
doodle
and
ladybug
they
rap
but
they
also
namecheck
charlie
parker
and
charles
mingus
other
songs
sample
rb
or
dance
music
to
great
effect
one
of
the
highlights
is
nickel
bag
which
is
built
around
a
curtis
mayfield
sample
all
in
all
there's
not
a
bum
song
on
the
cd
the
cd
is
full
of
quality
music
worthy
of
5
stars
in
many
ways
however
i
admittedly
get
somewhat
bored
when
i
listen
to
this
cd
start
to
finish

there
simply
isn't
enough
diversity
in
the
band's
mellow
sound
nevertheless
i
respect
this
cd
for
it's
time
it
was
a
fairly
adventurous
melding
of
rap
jazz
and
a
hippie
sensibility
along
with
arrested
development
and
us3
it
seemed
like
digable
planets
were
on
the
forefront
of
a
new
and
influential
style
of
rap
digable
planet's
second
cd
though
didn't
do
well
and
the
group
faded
quickly
unfortunately
many
people
probably
ended
up
thinking
that
rebirth
of
slick
is
their
only
worthwhile
song
one
listen
to
this
cd
will
dispel
that
belief

so
give
reachin'
(a
new
refutation
of
time
and
space)
a
chance

yeah
you

from

any

from

it'll
all
make

or
you
just
love

lay

give
this

jazzy

cd
digable
planets
just
about
started
their
own
subgenre
of
rap
when
they
meshed
the
beats
of
hiphop
and
the
coolness
of
jazz
together
they
aren't
the
only
ones
to
have
ever
done
it
but
they
did
it
incredibly
well
some
people
may
think
of
them
as
a
one
hit
wonder
but
if
you
liked
rebirth
of
slick
(cool
like
dat)
you'll
love
the
whole
album
even
a
decade
later
this
is
still
one
of
the
most
unique
albums
i
own
rap
or
not
the
only
current
group
i
know
similar
to
them
might
be

5
other

tracks
on
this
disc
are
it's
good
to
be
here

and
my

where

such
good
