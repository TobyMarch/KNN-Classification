music
biography
growing
up
in
a
nonmusical
family
in
phoenix
arizona
country
singer
dierks
bentley
got
his
country
music
education
on
his
own
listening
to
recordings
a
love
of
the
music
inspired
him
to
move
to
nashville
at
the
age
of
19
but
he
quickly
grew
discouraged
by
the
lack
of
public
and
professional
interest
coming
his
way
it
all
changed
when
he
walked
into
the
station
inn
a
bar
where
the
bluegrass
faithful
hang
out
an
allnight
jam
session
recharged
his
batteries
and
he
again
started
pursuing
gigs
he
landed
a
job
at
the
tnn
television
network
doing
research
on
classic
country
music
and
by
night
he
worked
on
his
demos
capitol
records
heard
the
artist
signed
him
and
released
his
selftitled
debut
dierks
bentley
in
2003
which
yielded
the
impossibly
catchy
single
what
was
i
thinkin'
bringing
his
love
of
merle
haggard
and
waylon
jennings
more
to
the
forefront
modern
day
drifter
followed
two
years
later
and
became
a
top
ten
hit
in
2006
he
returned
with
long
trip
alone
a
more
polished
effort
that
was
commercial
but
not
crass
greatest
hits
every
mile
a
memory
arrived
in
2008
a
bit
early
in
his
career
for
that
perhaps
but
it
did
contain
his
key
charting
singles
and
added
in
fanselected
live
tracks
as
a
bonus
making
it
a
nice
summation
of
bentley's
work
up
to
that
point
a
new
album
feel
that
fire
was
released
in
early
2009
followed
by
the
bluegrassthemed
up
on
the
ridge
in
2010
his
sixth
album
home
released
in
2012
featured
a
dozen
new
songs
that
the
singer
roadtested
on
tour
and
it
was
an
eclectic
and
varied
affair
with
guest
spots
from
little
big
town's
karen
fairchild
as
well
as
tim
o'brien
and
sam
bush
among
others
capitol
issued
his
selffunded
ep
country
and
cold
cans
that
summer
and
before
long
he
had
begun
sessions
for
what
would
be
his
seventh
fulllength
release
for
the
label
in
11
years
bourbon
in
kentucky
a
duet
with
kacey
musgraves
was
the
first
single
from
the
sessions
but
it
flopped
upon
its
june
2013
release
going
no
further
than
40
on
the
billboard
country
charts
a
second
single
i
hold
on
quickly
followed
and
went
into
the
top
ten
but
the
lack
of
of
success
for
bourbon
in
kentucky
was
a
factor
in
pushing
back
the
release
of
riser
it
didn't
appear
until
february
25
2014
