more
buffalo
springfield
apart
from
the
byrds
no
other
american
band
had
as
great
an
impact
on
folkrock
and
countryrock

really
the
entire
californian
rock
sound

than
buffalo
springfield
the
group's
formation
is
the
stuff
of
legend
driving
on
sunset
boulevard
in
los
angeles
stephen
stills
and
richie
furay
spotted
a
hearse
that
stills
was
sure
belonged
to
neil
young
a
canadian
he
had
crossed
paths
with
earlier
indeed
it
was
and
with
the
addition
of
fellow
hearse
passenger
and
canadian
bruce
palmer
on
bass
and
exdillard
dewey
martin
on
drums
the
cluster
of
exfolkys
determined
as
the
byrds
had
just
done
to
become
a
rock

roll
band
buffalo
springfield
wasn't
together
long

they
were
an
active
outfit
for
just
over
two
years
between
1967
and
1968
but
every
one
of
their
three
albums
was
noteworthy
their
debut
buffalo
springfield
including
their
sole
big
hit
(stills'
for
what
it's
worth)
established
them
as
the
best
folkrock
band
in
the
land
barring
the
byrds
though
springfield
was
a
bit
more
folk
and
country
oriented
again
their
second
album
found
the
group
expanding
their
folkrock
base
into
tough
hard
rock
and
psychedelic
orchestration
resulting
in
their
best
record
the
group
was
blessed
with
three
idiosyncratic
talented
songwriters
in
stills
young
and
furay
(the
last
of
whom
didn't
begin
writing
until
the
second
lp)
yet
they
also
had
strong
and
often
conflicting
egos
particularly
stills
and
young
the
group
who
held
almost
infinite
promise
rearranged
their
lineup
several
times
young
leaving
the
group
for
periods
and
palmer
fighting
deportation
until
disbanding
in
1968
their
final
album
clearly
shows
the
group
fragmenting
into
solo
directions
eventually
the
interpersonal
tensions
and
creative
battles
led
to
a
perhaps
inevitable
split
starting
with
young's
departure
for
a
solo
career
he
would
later
reunite
with
stephen
stills
in
crosby
stills

nash
joining
the
trio
once
a
decade
for
various
projects
in
addition
to
csn
stills
released
solo
albums
and
worked
with
a
nother
band
manassas
initially
jim
messina
and
richie
furay
stayed
together
forming
the
countryrock
group
poco
but
messina
left
after
three
albums
to
team
up
in
a
duo
with
kenny
loggins
furay
himself
left
poco
and
teamed
with
chris
hillman
and
jd
souther
in
the
souther
hillman
furay
band
before
pursuing
a
solo
career
rumors
of
a
buffalo
springfield
reunion
circulated
for
years

young
even
hinted
at
it
with
the
song
buffalo
springfield
again
and
it
finally
happened
in
the
fall
of
2010
young
furay
and
stills
reunited
as
buffalo
springfield
for
a
pair
of
shows
at
young's
annual
bridge
school
benefit
in
the
fall
of
2010
it
wasn't
a
complete
reunion
since
palmer
had
died
in
2004
and
martin
passed
in
2009
but
the
three
singers
used
bassist
rick
rosas
and
drummer
joe
vitale
to
fill
in
the
same
configuration
played
six
concerts
in
the
spring
of
2011
but
reportedly
did
no
studio
work

stills

young
campaigned
