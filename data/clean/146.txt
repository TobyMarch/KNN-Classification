discussing
the
reissue

included
stacks
of
'forgotten

the
band
said
in
a
statement
we
never
could
have
imagined
that
the
album
would
have
reached
so
many
people
throughout
the
world
we
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
this
past
year
digging
through
our
archives
and
asking
others
to
dig
through
theirs
in
the
hopes
of
uncovering
some
forgotten
material
'turn
on
the
bright
lights'
was
originally
released
in
2002
and
was
subsequently
followed
by
'antics'
in
2004
and
2007's
'our
love
to
admire'
before
'interpol'
followed
in
2010
