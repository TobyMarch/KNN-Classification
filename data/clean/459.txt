@dierksbentley
in
the
fall
of
2010
dierks
bentley
played
four
shows
in
four
nights
in
new
york
city
that
illustrate
just
how
unique
he
is
among
contemporary
country
music
artists
first
dierks
the
multiplatinum
arena
headliner
played
his
hits
at
the
bowery
ballroom
then
dierks
the
bluegrass
student
and
devotee
performed
with
the
del
mccoury
band
and
after
that
it
was
a
songwriter’s
night
with
fellow
music
row
tunesmiths
and
a
show
with
chris
thile’s
experimental
punch
brothers
probably
no
other
artist
on
country
radio
in
the
past
ten
years
could
manage
this
kind
of
range
and
versatility
especially
when
one
considers
the
broader
record
he’s
had
eight
no
1
singles
and
written
every
one
of
them
he’s
performed
at
lollapalooza
the
telluride
bluegrass
festival
bonnaroo
and
the
cma
music
festival
tailoring
his
sets
to
each
his
instantly
recognizable
voice
and
acoustic/electric
hybrid
sound
have
propelled
him
to
membership
in
the
grand
ole
opry
and
in
2011
a
performance
for
the
president
at
the
white
house
all
made
possible
by
his
devotion
to
developing
all
sides
of
his
musicianship
dierks
has
embraced
musical
diversity
in
his
recording
career
as
well
as
his
new
album
home
demonstrates
the
project
plunges
him
back
into
the
country
mainstream
after
a
successful
sojourn
in
bluegrass
and
roots
music
with
the
acclaimed
and
grammynominated
up
on
the
ridge
album
moreover
working
with
some
of
nashville’s
most
innovative
studio
musicians
home
finds
dierks
singing
over
some
new
sonic
textures
and
for
the
first
time
interpreting
a
few
songs
that
he
didn’t
write
himself
“i
definitely
stepped
away
from
the
commercial
country
world
for
a
little
while”
says
dierks
noting
that
his
last
such
album
feel
that
fire
album
came
out
in
early
2009
“that
seems
like
a
really
long
time
ago
so
this
record
feels
fresh
it
doesn’t
feel
like
a
continuation
of
any
other
project
or
series
of
recordings”
but
if
there’s
newness
there’s
also
a
distinct
familiarity
about
how
dierks
and
his
music
are
connecting
with
fans
this
sixth
album
of
his
capitol
records
nashville
career
produced
a
no
1
hit
even
before
its
release
that
albumopening
song
“am
i
the
only
one”
is
a
rallying
cry
to
the
funloving
dierks
army
and
it
sets
a
tone

a
goodtime
song
kicking
off
a
goodtime
record
fans
have
already
been
enjoying
tunes
like
“5150”
and
“diamonds
make
babies”
in
shows
the
recorded
versions
will
no
doubt
be
spilling
out
of
car
windows
as
the
weather
warms
up
in
2012
home’s
title
track
gives
the
mostly
lighthearted
album
a
vital
spiritual
anchor
the
song
expresses
pride
and
patriotism
without
sentimentality
or
illusions
it
unflinchingly
speaks
of
america’s
“scars”
and
her
tensions
while
illuminating
those
as
sources
of
strength
the
writing
session
took
place
just
four
days
after
the
shooting
in
tucson
az
(dierks’s
home
state)
which
took
six
lives
and
injured
congresswoman
gabrielle
giffords
that
tragedy
did
not
inspire
the
song
by
any
means
but
it
did
cast
a
shadow
and
influence
dierks
and
his
cowriters
once
some
opening
lines
popped
out
that
seemed
to
speak
to
the
vitality
of
being
an
american
in
these
challenging
times
“it’s
really
hard
to
write
a
patriotic
song”
confesses
dierks
“but
you
want
to
it’s
something
i
think
about
all
the
time
i
love
the
history
of
country
music
and
i
love
the
history
of
our
country”
he
seems
to
have
pulled
it
off
the
song
impressed
critics
and
earned
a
call
from
national
public
radio
dierks
was
able
to
tell
that
audience
that
the
aim
was
“to
be
inspiring
and
hopeful
but
also
address
the
realities
of
what's
going
on”
elsewhere
on
radio
country
stations
embraced
the
risky
single
despite
its
departures
from
any
flagwaving
formula
the
rest
of
the
project
is
divided
evenly
between
songs
dierks
cowrote
and
those
he
found
on
an
unprecedented
song
hunt
from
the
former
category
we
hear
“the
woods”
an
homage
to
another
side
of
home
the
privacy
afforded
by
those
littleknown
and
mysterious
backroads
and
fire
circles
where
friends
gather
and
rites
of
passage
take
place
dierks
also
cowrote
“breathe
you
in”
a
pure
act
of
romance
and
sonic
seduction
that
continues
the
tone
set
by
the
multiweek
chartopper
“come
a
little
closer”
a
few
years
ago
and
closing
the
album
dierks
and
jim
beavers
conceived
“thinking
of
you”
a
connecting
reassuring
song
that
comes
honestly
from
a
man
who’s
away
from
his
family
more
than
he’d
like
daughter
evie
makes
a
brief
guest
appearance
at
the
end
singing
the
record’s
appropriate
final
words
“daddy’s
home”
on
the
song
scouting
side
dierks
“reached
out
to
the
publishers
and
let
it
be
known
that
we
were
looking
for
great
songs
it
didn’t
matter
where
it
came
from
and
who
wrote
it
–
how
big
the
name
or
little
the
name
we
were
just
searching
for
as
many
songs
to
listen
to
as
possible”
he
says
the
results
are
rich
“diamonds
make
babies”
is
a
country
cranker
bristling
with
electric
guitar
and
a
great
beat
but
the
true
hook
is
the
lyric
a
wry
and
worldlywise
bit
of
advice
to
an
eager
suitor
who
thinks
he’s
ready
to
get
down
on
one
knee
and
offer
the
stone
dierks
also
throws
his
vocal
power
up
to
“in
my
head”
which
explores
the
fine
line
between
love
and
obsession
against
a
driving
pulsing
track
and
dierks
reaches
back
to
the
influence
of
one
of
his
favorite
musicians
–
jamie
hartford
–
in
recording
“when
you
gonna
come
around”
the
slowdance
of
a
song
is
a
duet
with
the
wonderful
karen
fairchild
of
little
big
town
and
offers
some
of
the
most
organic
textures
and
honest
vocals
on
the
album
dierks
bentley’s
career
in
country
music
could
be
taught
in
music
business
classes
because
of
its
rare
balance
of
commercial
success
and
artistic
breadth
most
young
nashville
newcomers
who
gravitate
to
the
station
inn
and
the
city’s
bluegrass
heritage
are
not
the
ones
who
wind
up
on
arena
stages
the
city’s
not
programmed
that
way
even
if
it
should
be
but
dierks
made
some
savvy
choices
soaking
up
sound
and
wisdom
on
tuesday
night
bluegrass
shows
and
on
wednesday
nights
on
lower
broadway
with
the
twanging
electrifying
jamie
hartford
band
in
those
same
days
his
day
job
at
the
nashville
network’s
tape
vault
gave
him
access
to
a
library
of
classic
country
music
performances
which
he
soaked
up
like
a
sponge
under
these
many
influences
he
wrote
and
recorded
songs
that
honored
the
past
and
the
heritage
while
saying
something
fresh
early
songs
like
“i
wish
it
would
break”
and
“bartenders
barstools
and
barmaids”
suggested
this
was
a
writer/artist
who
could
add
something
to
the
country
tradition
while
speaking
a
contemporary
language
that
promise
was
fulfilled
upon
teaming
up
with
capitol
with
the
shocking
no
1
debut
“what
was
i
thinkin’?”
it
continued
with
indelible
hits
including
“settle
for
a
slowdown”
and
“every
mile
a
memory”
the
tone
for
dierks’s
career
was
truly
set
in
2005
he
won
the
cma’s
horizon
award
for
most
exceptional
emerging
artist
and
his
passion
for
and
stewardship
of
classic
country
music
earned
him
membership
in
the
grand
ole
opry
where
he
was
the
third
youngest
artist
ever
to
be
inducted
the
first
grammy
award
nominations
came
in
2007
and
they
quickly
became
routine
through
the
critically
acclaimed
up
on
the
ridge
album
he’s
earned
ten
grammy
nods
and
throughout
dierks
has
pursued
a
broadbased
strategy
on
the
road
juggling
arena
dates
supporting
george
strait
with
club
and
college
shows
and
now
balancing
headliner
status
in
country
music
settings
with
gritty
jammy
tours
of
rock
venues
“i
walk
a
different
path”
dierks
says
“because
of
my
love
of
acoustic
music
i
have
opportunities
to
do
different
musical
things
it’s
not
just
one
type
of
show
which
i
really
think
would
be
a
lot
easier!”
reflecting
on
a
career
that’s
sent
him
from
the
bars
of
lower
broadway
to
the
top
of
country
music
dierks
is
a
mix
of
amazement
gratitude
and
determination
“i
don’t
know
what
the
next
ten
years
holds
but
i
think
i’ve
put
myself
in
a
position
where
i
can
satisfy
all
of
the
different
things
that
i
love
about
music”
throughout
this
journey
(and
critical
to
it)
dierks
has
sought
out
and
made
use
of
technologies
that
could
help
erase
the
distance
between
himself
and
his
fans
the
website
that
went
up
before
the
release
of
home
is
perhaps
the
most
audacious
expression
of
that
yet
the
album’s
cover
is
rendered
as
a
mosaic
of
miniscule
images
farmed
form
dierks’s
nearly
200000
twitter
followers
drag
over
it
and
the
faces
pop
out
in
a
magnifier
click
on
any
tile
and
up
pops
what
they’ve
been
saying
–
to
dierks
and
each
other
it’s
like
a
microcosm
of
everything
dierks
has
cultivated
in
his
fan
base
connectivity
and
immediacy
he’s
done
things
his
own
way
satisfied
his
own
muses
and
done
all
he
can
do
to
bring
all
kinds
of
fans
along
with
him
there’s
every
reason
to
think
they’ll
follow
him
home
too
