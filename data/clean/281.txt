history
[edit]
before
debut
album
[edit]
tom
scholz
first
started
writing
music
in
1969
while
he
was
attending
mit
where
he
wrote
an
instrumental
titled
foreplay[4]
while
attending
mit
scholz
joined
the
band
freehold
where
he
met
guitarist
barry
goudreau
and
drummer
jim
masdea
who
would
later
become
members
of
boston
vocalist
brad
delp
was
added
to
the
collective
in
1970
after
graduating
with
a
master's
degree[5]
scholz
worked
for
polaroid
where
he
used
his
salary
to
build
a
recording
studio
in
his
basement
and
to
finance
demo
tapes
recorded
in
professional
recording
studios[4]
these
early
demo
tapes
were
recorded
with
(at
various
times)
brad
delp
on
vocals
barry
goudreau
on
guitar
jim
masdea
on
drums
and
scholz
on
guitar
bass
and
keyboards

the
demo
tapes
were
sent
to
record
companies
but
received
consistent
rejections[4]
in
1973
scholz
formed
the
band
mother's
milk
with
delp
goudreau
and
masdea[4]
that
group
disbanded
by
1974
but
scholz
subsequently
worked
with
masdea
and
delp
to
produce
six
new
demos
including
more
than
a
feeling
peace
of
mind
rock
and
roll
band
something
about
you
(then
entitled
life
isn't
easy)
hitch
a
ride
(then
entitled
san
francisco
day)
and
don't
be
afraid
scholz
stated
they
finished
four
of
the
six
by
the
end
of
1974
as
they
finished
more
than
a
feeling
and
something
about
you
in
1975[6][7]
scholz
played
all
the
instruments
on
the
demos
except
for
the
drums
which
were
played
by
masdea
and
used
selfdesigned
pedals
to
create
the
desired
guitar
sound[4]
the
violinlike
sound
of
the
guitars
was
created
in
the
early
1970s
by
scholz
and
it
became
a
truly
distinctive
innovation
in
american
music[8]
from

barry
goudreau

scholz

hashian
brad
delp
fran
sheehan
in
1977
this
final
demo
tape
attracted
the
attention
of
promoters
paul
ahern
and
charlie
mckenzie
masdea
left
the
band
around
this
time
according
to
scholz
the
managers
insisted
that
masdea
had
to
be
replaced
before
the
band
could
get
a
recording
deal[4]
years
later
delp
told
journalist
chuck
miller
[jim]
actually
told
me
he
was
losing
interest
in
playing
drums
i
know
tom
felt
very
bad
when
the
whole
thing
happened
and
then
of
course
we
started
getting
some
interest[9][10]
scholz
and
delp
signed
a
deal
with
epic
records
after
masdea's
departure
thanks
to
ahern

mckenzie
before
the
deal
could
be
finalized
the
band
had
to
do
a
live
audition
for
the
record
company
executives
the
duo
quickly
recruited
goudreau
on
guitar
bassist
fran
sheehan
and
drummer
sib
hashian
to
create
a
performing
unit
which
could
replicate
scholz's
richly
layered
recordings
on
stage
the
showcase
was
a
success
and
the
band
agreed
to
put
out
10
albums
over
the
next
six
years[4][9]
in
addition
to
the
firing
of
masdea
the
record
label
also
insisted
that
scholz
rerecord
the
demo
tapes
in
a
professional
studio
however
scholz
wanted
the
record
to
be
recorded
in
his
basement
studio
so
that
he
could
work
at
his
own
pace[4]
upon
request
of
tom
scholz
masdea
played
drums
on
the
track
rock
and
roll
band
and
the
instrumentation
was
recorded
in
scholz's
studio[4]
the
multitrack
tapes
were
then
brought
to
los
angeles
where
brad
delp
added
vocals
and
the
album
was
mixed
by
john
boylan
it
was
then
that
the
band
was
named
boston
by
suggestion
of
boylan
and
engineer
warren
dewey[4]
boston
(1976)
[edit]
brad
delp
the
original
lead
singer
along
with
scholz
delp
was
the
only
other
person
signed
to
epic
records
as
boston
the
debut
album
boston
released
on
august
8
1976
was
an
enormous
success
the
record
ranks
as
the
bestselling
debut
album
in
us
history
with
over
17
million
copies
sold[11]
during
the
late
summer
and
early
fall
of
1976
boston
attracted
much
publicity
due
to
the
unprecedented
record
sales
by
an
unknown
act
its
unique
sound
and
singer
brad
delp's
vocal
abilities
however
there
was
a
conscious
effort
to
deemphasize
scholz
as
the
total
mastermind
behind
boston[12]
after
opening
for
black
sabbath
blue
&oumlyster
cult
foghat
and
others
in
the
autumn
the
band
embarked
on
a
headlining
tour
in
the
winter
and
spring
of
19761977
to
support
the
album[13]
this
helped
establish
boston
as
one
of
rock's
top
acts
within
a
short
time
being
nominated
for
a
grammy
award
as
a
best
new
artist[13][14]
boston
was
the
first
band
in
history
to
make
their
new
york
city
debut
at
madison
square
garden[12]
the
album
spawned
three
singles
more
than
a
feeling
long
time
and
peace
of
mind
all
of
which
made
the
national
charts[13]
additionally
the
album
peaked
at
no&nbsp3
on
the
billboard
200
and
remained
on
the
charts
for
132
weeks[15]
don't
look
back
(1978)
[edit]
despite
having
problems
with
manager
paul
ahern
being
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
fight
between
ahern
and
his
business
partner
charles
mckenzie
and
doing
most
of
the
recording
work
alone[12]
scholz
completed
the
second
boston
album
two
years
after
the
debut
album's
release
the
second
album
don't
look
back
was
released
by
epic
in
august
1978
at
the
time
this
was
considered
a
long
gap
between
albums
but
scholz
still
considered
don't
look
back
to
be
a
rush
job
and
was
unhappy
with
the
album's
second
side
in
particular[16]
overall
don't
look
back
sold
about
half
as
well
as
the
debut
album
eventually
selling
over
7
million
records[17]
another
tour
followed
and
the
album's
title
track
became
a
top
5
hit
additionally
two
other
singles
a
man
i'll
never
be
and
feelin'
satisfied
went
top
40
and
top
50
respectively[13]
despite
the
success
scholz's
relationship
with
ahern
completely
deteriorated[18]
delayed
by
technical
renovations
to
his
studio
scholz
eventually
began
the
process
of
working
on
boston's
third
album
determined
to
complete
the
album
at
his
own
pace
and
up
to
his
demanding
standard
solo
projects
and
cbs
lawsuit
(1979–1985)
[edit]
in
late
1979
scholz
began
writing
new
material
but
boston's
former
comanager
paul
ahern
argued
that
according
to
an
agreement
scholz
had
signed
years
earlier
with
ahern
ahern
owned
a
percentage
of
all
songs
scholz
wrote
from
that
point
on[18]
delayed
further
by
the
dispute
scholz
suggested
that
in
the
meantime
the
individual
members
should
work
on
whatever
other
projects
they
might
be
considering
goudreau
then
decided
to
record
a
solo
album
that
featured
boston
members
delp
and
hashian
and
which
was
recorded
with
the
help
of
paul
grupp[19]
an
engineer
and
producer
familiar
with
scholz's
studio
techniques[13]
the
album
released
in
1980
was
titled
barry
goudreau
and
featured
the
minor
hit
single
dreams
there
was
tension
when
cbs's
marketing
connected
goudreau's
solo
album
to
boston's
signature
guitar
sound
despite
scholz
not
having
played
at
all
on
this
album[16][20]
scholz
objected
to
the
ad
copy
but
it
became
irrelevant
when
epic
dropped
promotion
on
goudreau's
album
citing
lack
of
interest
goudreau
left
the
band
in
1981
and
formed
orion
the
hunter
delp
contributed
vocals
and
cowrote
songs
on
the
debut
album
but
returned
to
boston
and
recorded
vocals
on
the
third
boston
album[13]
while
scholz
and
delp
were
recording
new
material
for
the
third
boston
album
cbs
filed
a
$60
million
lawsuit
against
scholz
alleging
breach
of
contract
for
failing
to
deliver
a
new
boston
album
on
time[13]
during
this
same
period
scholz
founded
his
successful
hightech
company
scholz
research

development
(srd)
which
made
amplifiers
and
other
musical
electronic
equipment
its
most
famous
product
the
rockman
amplifier
was
introduced
in
1982[21]
the
legal
trouble
slowed
progress
toward
the
completion
of
the
next
album
which
took
six
years
to
record
and
produce
joining
scholz
in
the
album's
development

were
delp
and
jim
masdea[22]

work
with
scholz
as
both
a
musician
and
an
srd
executive
as
cbs
v
scholz
played
out
in
court
cbs
opted
to
withhold
royalty
payments
to
scholz
hoping
to
force
him
to
settle
on
unfavorable
terms[13]
the
lawsuit's
first
round
was
eventually
decided
in
scholz's
favor
and
scholz
moved
the
band
to
mca

band
member
kimberley
dahme
and
a
boston
fan
from
north
carolina
named
tommy
decarlo
who
was
chosen
to
sing
based
on
his
performances
of
boston
cover
songs
on
his
myspace
page[32][33]
another
former
boston
vocalist
fran
cosmo

on

sib
hashian
while
present
refused

go
on

with
the
other
boston
alumni
citing
discomfort
with
tom
scholz[34]
present

(since
2008)
[edit]
the
ongoing
conflicts
among
the
surviving
band
members
spilled
over
to
the
2008
presidential
campaign
barry
goudreau
appeared
with
mike
huckabee
and
played
with
him
at
some
rallies
in
new
hampshire[35]
huckabee
used
more
than
a
feeling
as
a
campaign
theme
song[35]
scholz
a
selfdescribed
obama
supporter[36]
sent
an
open
letter
to
huckabee
in
february
2008
stating
that
the
band
had
never
endorsed
any
candidate
and
that
he
had
never
authorized
the
use
of
more
than
a
feeling
as
huckabee's
theme
song[35]
scholz
made
a
point
of
saying
that
he
and
not
goudreau
or
sheehan
actually
played
all
the
guitars
on
more
than
a
feeling
as
well
as
most
of
boston’s
songs[36]
huckabee
did
stop
using
more
than
a
feeling
as
a
theme
song
in
the
spring
of
2008
scholz
and
sweet
introduced
a
new
boston
lineup
which
subsequently
did
a
north
american
summer
tour
playing
53
dates
in
12
weeks
(on
a
double
bill
with
styx)
scholz
was
the
only
founding
member
of
boston
to
play
on
the
tour
although

emblazoned

also

on

late
80's
and
early
90's
tours
in
the
form
of
a
giant
lighting
rig
and
accompanied
on
stage
by
their
giant
pipe
organ
set
piece
which
is
known
to
boston
insiders
as
bertha
because
of
its
sheer
size
innovation
and
style
[edit]
boston's
genre
is
considered
by
most
to
be
hard
rock
while
combining
elements
of
progressive
rock
into
their
music[28][42]
former
singer
brad
delp
was
well
known
for
his
extended
vocal
ranges
shown
on
hits
such
as
more
than
a
feeling[43]
guitarist
and
primary
song
writer
tom
scholz'
blend
of
musical
styles
ranging
from
classical
to
1960s
english
pop
has
resulted
in
a
unique
sound
most
consistently
realized
on
the
first
two
albums
(boston
and
don't
look
back)
this
sound
is
characterized
by
multiple
lead
and
blended
harmonies
guitar
work
(usually
harmonized
in
thirds)
often
alternating
between
and
then
mixing
electric
and
acoustic
guitars
the
band's
harmonic
style
has
been
characterized
as
being
violinlike
without
using
synthesizers[44]
scholz
is
wellregarded
for
the
development
of
complex
multitracked
guitar
harmonies
another
contributing
factor
is
the
use
of
handmade
high
tech
equipment
such
as
the
rockman
used
by
artists
such
as
journey
guitarist
neal
schon
the
band
zz
top
and
ted
nugent
def
leppard's
album
hysteria
was
created
using
only
rockman
technology
scholz'
production
style
combines
deep
aggressive
comparatively
short
guitar
riffing
and
nearly
ethereal
generally
longer
note
vocal
harmonies
a
heavier
lower
and
darker
overall
approach
came
in
the
next
two
albums
(third
stage
and
walk
on)
the
original
track
higher
power
on
the
greatest
hits
album
exhibits
a
near
germanic
almost
techno
influence
with
its
sequencersounding
keyboards
a
sound
most
fully
realized
on
corporate
america's
title
track
singer
brad
delp
who
was
strongly
influenced
by
the
beatles[45]
is
also
credited
for
helping
to
create
boston's
sound
with
his
signature
