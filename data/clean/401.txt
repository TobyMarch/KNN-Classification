thin
lizzy
is
one
of
rock
music's
most
recognizable
names
the
fiery
dublin
band
exploded
onto
the
scene
with
a
fresh
sound
look
and
attitude
lead
by
the
incomparable
phil
lynott
the
band
reached
many
peaks
and
influenced
generations
of
musicians
with
classic
tracks
such
as
jailbreak
the
boys
are
back
in
town
still
in
love
with
you
cold
sweat
emerald
and
don't
believe
a
word
most
rock
historians
would
agree
the
pinnacle
of
their
commercial
success
was
in
1983
followed
by
the
bands'
premature
demise
as
they
played
their
last
gig
in
september
of
1984
just
two
years
later
the
world
was
shocked
when
singer/bassist
and
founding
member
phil
lynott
passed
away
at
the
age
of
thirty
six
twenty
five
years
have
passed
the
world
has
changed
but
the
amazing
body
of
work
that
is
thin
lizzy
still
retains
all
of
its
vibrancy
and
influence
a
new
lineup
has
formed
to
take
lizzy's
music
to
a
whole
new
generation
of
music
fans
led
by
alumni
scott
gorham
brian
downey
and
darren
wharton
(all
of
whom
