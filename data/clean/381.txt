stands
as

mark
in
an
already
remarkable
body
of
work
rich
with
passion

and
the
unerring
confidence
of
a
true
survivor
though
allman
has
been
a
constant
presence
on
the
road
over
the
past
decade
with
the
allman
brothers
band
as
well
as
with
his
own
crack
combo
he
has
spent
precious
little
time
in
the
studio
since
the
2002
death
of
producer
tom
dowd
–
the
man
behind
the
glass
for
much
of
his
recorded
career
so
when
his
manager
suggested
he
veer
off
from
a
2009
tour
for
a
memphis
meeting
with
the
multiple
grammy
awardwinning
burnett
allman
admits
to
being
not
entirely
enthused
“i
said
‘oh
man
i
don’t
wanna
start
meeting
a
string
of
dudes
all
of
‘em
trying
to
outdo
the
other
one”
he
recalls
“but
we
stopped
in
memphis
and
here
comes
t
bone
the
first
sentence
out
of
his
mouth
was
something
like
‘tommy
dowd
was
the
man
wasn’t
he?
i’ve
patterned
a
lot
of
my
stuff
after
that
gentleman’
i
thought
‘right
what’ve
we
got
here?’”
the
two
musicians
quickly
bonded
chatting
about
favorite
records
mutual
friends
and
reminiscences
of
nashville’s
renowned
clear
channel
station
wlac
which
introduced
rhythm

blues
music
to
a
generation
of
late
night
listeners
from
new
york
to
miami
“he
told
me
some
guy
gave
him
a
hard
drive
it
has
10000
obscure
blues
songs”
allman
says
“he
says
‘i’m
gonna
pick
out
twenty
of
‘em
and
send
‘em
to
ya
and
you
tell
me
what
you
think’
he
said
‘they’re
old
like
billie
holliday
old
and
when
you
listen
to
‘em
i
want
you
to
think
about
us
gettin’
in
there
and
about
bringin’
‘em
up
to
today’”
allman
found
the
idea
irresistible
and
in
january
2010
a
stunning
combo
was
assembled
at
los
angeles’
the
village
recorder
comprising
burnett
and
doyle
bramhall
ii
on
guitars
backed
by
the
brilliant
rhythm
section
of
upright
bassist
dennis
crouch
and
drummer
jay
bellerose
what’s
more
the
lineup
included
a
brass
section
arranged
and
conducted
by
trumpeter
darrell
leonard
whose
illustrious
resume
extends
back
to
his
work
with
delaney

bonnie

friends
(featuring
gregg’s
late
great
brother
duane)
as
if
that
weren’t
enough
sitting
in
on
piano
was
a
dear
old
friend
the
night
tripper
himself
mac
“dr
john”
rebennack
with
whom
allman
cowrote
“let
this
be
a
lesson
to
ya’”
on
the
gregg
allman
band’s
1977
classic
playin’
up
a
storm
“t
bone
knew
that
that
him
being
there
would
put
a
certain
fire
in
my
ass”
allman
says
“it
was
so
good
seeing
dr
john
both
of
us
being
sober
‘cause
last
time
i
saw
him
both
of
us
were
pretty
much
nose
to
the
floor
he’s
such
a
nice
dude
he’s
funny
god
is
he
funny
before
he
was
so
stoned
it
didn’t
really
come
out
full
force
but
oh
man
he
is
hilarious!”
this
powerhouse
band
–
which
of
course
also
features
gregg’s
own
acoustic
guitar
expertise
and
trademark
hammond
b3
organ
–
cooks
up
an
earthy
and
atmospheric
musical
stew
infused
with
gritty
rb
muscle
spooky
southern
psychedelia
and
greasy
deep
soul
grooves
“the
band
was
just
a
bitch
man”
allman
says
“it’s
not
all
just
a
wall
of
guitars
–
not
that
there’s
anything
at
all
wrong
with
the
brothers
because
that’s
very
very
tasty”
the
tracking
came
fast
and
furious
kicking
off
with
an
ominous
take
on
sleepy
john
estes’
ominous
“floating
bridge”
from
there
the
album
covers
the
blues’
many
emotional
terrains
from
exuberant
showstoppers
like
little
milton’s
“blind
man”
and
the
album’s
one
original
composition
the
swaggering
“just
another
rider”
(cowritten
with
longtime
abb
guitarist
warren
haynes)
to
skip
james’
haunted
“devil
got
my
woman”
and
the
weary
but
unbowed
traditional
“rolling
stone”
“if
it
works
right
it
all
turns
real
magic”
allman
says
“and
that’s
what
happened
this
time
more
so
i
think
than
anything
i’ve
ever
recorded
we
got
15
masters
in
11
days
let
me
tell
ya
they
just
went
pop!
pop!
pop!
pop!”
when
it
came
to
vocals
burnett
was
determined
to
push
allman
out
of
his
comfort
zone
encouraging
spontaneity
and
soul
above
all
else
“first
takes
scare
me
to
death”
he
says
“they
really
do
on
about
three
or
maybe
four
of
‘em
bone
comes
over
the
microphone
‘alright
we
got
it’
i
said
‘well
wait
hold
it
hold
it!
what
do
you
mean
got
it?
we
just
ran
it
down!’
‘no
we
got
it’
i
went
back
in
the
control
room
i
said
‘man
i
know
i
can
get
it
better
than
that’
he
says
‘what’s
wrong
with
that?’
i
said
‘well
nothin’s
wrong
with
it
i
just
think
i
can
do
it
with
a
little
more
interesting
feel’
so
we
went
back
out
there
i
tried
man
i
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
nope”
indeed
allman’s
instantly
identifiable
voice
remains
a
wonder
wringing
nuance
and
history
from
every
lyric
“i
have
an
evolved
throat”
he
says
“i
think
i’m
a
little
more
meticulous
now
i’m
a
real
stickler
for
melody
i
used
to
think
more
about
beat
than
i
did
about
melody
but
now
i
think
about
both
of
‘em
see
you’ve
got
to
have
beat
because
first
of
all
you’ve
got
to
feel
something
as
well
as
hear
it
both
of
those
entities
have
to
be
really
personified
in
my
book”
like
any
genuine
bluesman
allman’s
own
life
has
been
colored
by
myriad
triumphs
and
too
many
tragedies
low
country
blues
was
initially
slated
for
a
mid2010
release
but
that
plan
changed
when
gregg
who
had
long
battled
chronic
hepatitis
c
was
notified
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
a
liver
transplant
in
june
2010
he
entered
the
mayo
clinic
in
jacksonville
florida
where
he
successfully
underwent
the
difficult
surgery
knowing
that
he
had
only
just
made
one
of
the
defining
albums
of
his
recorded
career
proved
to
be
the
best
medicine
giving
allman
the
inner
strength
he
needed
to
fully
heal
“this
record’s
one
of
the
things
that’s
held
me
together”
he
says
“because
when
i
woke
up
in
the
hospital
from
this
incredibly
big
surgery
i
held
on
to
the
idea
that
hey
man
you’ve
got
a
record
in
the
can!”
an
inveterate
road
warrior
allman
is
understandably
itching
to
return
to
the
endless
highway
he
spent
the
months
following
the
surgery
hitting
both
the
gym
and
the
rehearsal
studio
working
hard
to
restore
his
vitality
to
its
requisite
level
moreover
allman
is
justifiably
proud
of
low
country
blues
and
is
eager
to
get
out
there
to
bring
these
songs
to
his
countless
fans
“when
you
have
a
new
record
it
always
feels
different”
he
says
“man
you
gotta
get
out
there
and
move
the
muscles
you
gotta
move
it
and
shake
it”
“it’s
been
too
long”
he
adds
“i
guess
i
was
just
born
with
a
lot
of
gypsy
in
my
soul”
simply
put
low
country
blues
is
gregg
allman
at
his
very
best
a
selfassured
spirited
collection
that
will
stand
as
a
major
milestone
in
what
is
undeniably
an
exceptional
career
“places
you
been
things
that
you
done/somehow
you’re
still
on
the
run”
allman
sings
on
“just
another
rider”

introduced
rhythm

blues
music
to
a
generation
of
late
night
listeners
from
new

to
miami
“he
told
me
some
guy
gave
him
a
hard
drive
it
has
10000
obscure
blues
songs”
allman
says
“he
says
‘i’m
gonna
pick
out
twenty
of
‘em
and
send
‘em
to
ya
and
you
tell

he

‘they’re

i
want
you
to
think
about
us
gettin’
in
there
and
about
bringin’
‘em
up
to
today’”
allman
found
the
idea
irresistible
and
in
january
2010
a
stunning
combo
was
assembled
at
los
angeles’
the
village
recorder
comprising
burnett
and
doyle
bramhall
ii
on
guitars
backed
by
the
brilliant
rhythm
section
of
upright
bassist

and
drummer

what’s
more
the
lineup
included
a
brass
section
arranged
and
conducted
by
trumpeter
darrell
leonard
whose
illustrious
resume
extends
back
to
his
work
with
delaney

bonnie

friends
(featuring
gregg’s
late
great
brother
duane)
as
if
that
weren’t
enough
sitting
in
on
piano
was
a
dear
old
friend
the
night
tripper
himself
mac
“dr
john”
rebennack
with
whom
allman
cowrote
“let
this
be
a
lesson
to
ya’”
on
the
gregg
allman
band’s
1977
classic
playin’
up
a
storm
“t
bone
knew
that
that
him
being
there
would
put
a
certain
fire
in
my
ass”
allman
says
“it
was
so
good
seeing
dr
john
both
of
us
being
sober
‘cause
last
time
i
saw
him
both
of
us
were
pretty
much
nose
to
the
floor
he’s
such
a
nice
dude
he’s
funny
god
is
he
funny
before
he
was
so
stoned
it
didn’t
really
come
out
full
force
but
oh
man
he
is
hilarious!”
this
powerhouse
band
–
which
of
course
also
features
gregg’s
own
acoustic
guitar
expertise
and
trademark
hammond
b3
organ
–
cooks
up
an
earthy
and
atmospheric
musical
stew
infused
with
gritty
rb
muscle
spooky
southern
psychedelia
and
greasy
deep
soul
grooves
“the
band
was
just
a
bitch
man”
allman
says
“it’s
not
all
just
a
wall
of
guitars
–
not
that
there’s
anything
at
all
wrong
with
the
brothers
because
that’s
very
very
tasty”
the
tracking
came
fast
and
furious
kicking
off
with
an
ominous
take
on
sleepy
john
estes’
ominous
“floating
bridge”
from
there
the
album
covers
the
blues’
many
emotional
terrains
from
exuberant
showstoppers
like
little
milton’s
“blind
man”
and
the
album’s
one
original
composition
the
swaggering
“just
another
rider”
(cowritten
with
longtime
abb
guitarist
warren
haynes)
to
skip
james’
haunted
“devil
got
my
woman”
and
the
weary
but
unbowed
traditional
“rolling
stone”
“if
it
works
right
it
all
turns
real
magic”
allman
says
“and
that’s
what
happened
this
time
more
so
i
think
than
anything
i’ve
ever
recorded
we
got
15
masters
in
11
days
let
me
tell
ya
they
just
went
pop!
pop!
pop!
pop!”
when
it
came
to
vocals
burnett
was
determined
to
push
allman
out
of
his
comfort
zone
encouraging
spontaneity
and
soul
above
all
else
“first
takes
scare
me
to
death”
he
says
“they
really
do
on
about
three
or
maybe
four
of
‘em
bone
comes
over
the
microphone
‘alright
we
got
it’
i
said
‘well
wait
hold
it
hold
it!
what
do
you
mean
got
it?
we
just
ran
it
down!’
‘no
we
got
it’
i
went
back
in
the
control
room
i
said
‘man
i
know
i
can
get
it
better
than
that’
he
says
‘what’s
wrong
with
that?’
i
said
‘well
nothin’s
wrong
with
it
i
just
think
i
can
do
it
with
a
little
more
interesting
feel’
so
we
went
back
out
there
i
tried
man
i
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
nope”
indeed
allman’s
instantly
identifiable
voice
remains
a
wonder
wringing
nuance
and
history
from
every
lyric
“i
have
an
evolved
throat”
he
says
“i
think
i’m
a
little
more
meticulous
now
i’m
a
real
stickler
for
melody
i
used
to
think
more
about
beat
than
i
did
about
melody
but
now
i
think
about
both
of
‘em
see
you’ve
got
to
have
beat
because
first
of
all
you’ve
got
to
feel
something
as
well
as
hear
it
both
of

have
to
be

been
colored

triumphs

had
only
just
made
one
of

proved
to
be
the
best

giving
allman
the
inner
strength
he
needed
to
fully
heal
“this
record’s
one
of
the
things
that’s
held
me
together”
he
says
“because
when
i

up
in

from
this
incredibly
big
surgery
i
held
on
to
the
idea
that
hey

an
inveterate

warrior
allman
is
understandably
itching

he
spent
the
months
following
the
surgery
hitting
both
the
gym
and
the
rehearsal
studio
working
hard
to
restore
his
vitality
to
its

moreover
allman
is
justifiably
proud
of
low

and
is
eager
to
get
out
there
to
bring
these
songs
to
his
countless
fans
“when

“it’s

“i’ve
got
my
hand
over
my
heart”
gregg
allman
says
of
his
extraordinary
new
album
“and
if
it’s
a
hit
there
it’s
a
hit”
as
a
founding
member
of
the
one
and
only
allman
brothers
band
and
in
his
own
storied
solo
career
allman
has
long
been
a
gifted
natural
interpreter
of
the
blues
his
soulful
and
distinctive
voice
one
of
the
defining
sounds
in
the
history
of
american
music
low
country
blues
marks
the
legendary
rock

roll
hall
of
famer’s
seventh
solo
recording
and
first
in
more
than
13
years
produced
by
t
bone
burnett
the
album
finds
allman
putting
his
own
stamp
on
songs
by
some
of
the
blues
giants
whose
work
has
long
influenced
his
own
from
muddy
waters
and
bb
king
to
buddy
guy
and
magic
sam
named
for
the
coastal
georgia
region
allman
calls
home
low
country
blues
stands
as
a
high
water
mark
in
an
already
remarkable
body
of
work
rich
with
passion
verve
and
the
unerring
confidence
of
a
true
survivor
though
allman
has
been
a
constant
presence
on
the
road
over
the
past
decade
with
the
allman
brothers
band
as
well
as
with
his
own
crack
combo
he
has
spent
precious
little
time
in
the
studio
since
the
2002
death
of
producer
tom
dowd
–
the
man
behind
the
glass
for
much
of
his
recorded
career
so
when
his
manager
suggested
he
veer
off
from
a
2009
tour
for
a
memphis
meeting
with
the
multiple
grammy
awardwinning
burnett
allman
admits
to
being
not
entirely
enthused
“i
said
‘oh
man
i
don’t
wanna
start
meeting
a
string
of
dudes
all
of
‘em
trying
to
outdo
the
other
one”
he
recalls
“but
we
stopped
in
memphis
and
here
comes
t
bone
the
first
sentence
out
of
his
mouth
was
something
like
‘tommy
dowd
was
the
man
wasn’t
he?
i’ve
patterned
a
lot
of
my
stuff
after
that
gentleman’
i
thought
‘right
what’ve
we
got
here?’”
the
two
musicians
quickly
bonded
chatting
about
favorite
records
mutual
friends
and
reminiscences
of
nashville’s
renowned
clear
channel
station
wlac

introduced
