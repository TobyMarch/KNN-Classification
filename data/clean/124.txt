am
et
if
there's
such
a
thing
as
a
golden
smog
purist
that
poor
cad
is
probably
wallowing
in
a
microbrew
in
some
dank
minneapolis
bar
bemoaning
the
loss
of
the
good
old
days
when
the
smog
could
be
counted
on
for
random
acts
of
irrelevance
and
the
sloppiest
covers
this
side
of
dread
zeppelin
sure
each
member
had
his
regular
day
job
in
bands
like
soul
asylum
the
jayhawks
etc
but
each
left
all
his
lofty
pretensions
of
serious
songwriting
at
the
door
when
he
adopted
his
smog
alter
ego
alas
before
long
smog
stopped
playing
around
town
regularly
and
started
writing
recording
and
even
touring
as
a
genuine
band
of
sorts
but
at
least
with
1995's
down
on
the
old
mainstream
they
had
the
cheek
to
use
fun
pseudonyms
a
la
the
travelling
wilburys
and
to
throw
in
messy
pisstakes
like
red
headed
stepchild
and
he's
a
dick
but
what
is
one
to
make
of
this
new
golden
smog
album
weird
tales?
damned
if
the
songs
are
good
enough
for
the
smoggers'
real
bands

the
jayhawks
(gary
louris
and
marc
perlman)
soul
asylum
(dan
murphy)
wilco
(jeff
tweedy)
big
star
(jody
stephens)
and
run
westy
run
(kraig
johnson)
and
double
damn
even
the
fake
names

a
concession
to
their
different
record
labels

are
gone
we
don't
do
the
michael
macklyn
stuff
anymore
explains
macklyn

er
louris
in
a
phone
call
from
the
twin
cities
that's
in
the
past
that's
no
longer
needed
and
no
longer
cute
sigh
have
at
it
then
louris

tell
us
where
it
all
went
wrong
and
golden
smog
started
getting
so
damn
good
back
when
y'all
started
gigging
as
golden
smog
did
you
have
any
idea
that
you'd
end
up
recording
albums
of
original
material?
not
at
all
it
was
strictly
a
way
for
us
to
hang
out
because
it
was
always
more
fun
for
us
as
musicians
to
just
go
out
and
play
than
to
sit
around
and
watch
so
here
we
were
able
to
get
paid
get
free
drink
tickets
and
hang
out
with
our
friends
who
were
on
stage
or
in
the
audience
and
it
was
just
strictly
as
a
goof
at
the
beginning
but
you
can
only
do
that
for
so
many
times

after
a
while
you've
either
got
to
take
it
to
the
next
level
or
not
do
it
anymore
so
when
did
the
first
incarnation
come
together?
it's
hard
to
trace
i
remember
seeing
dave
[pirner]
and
dan
[murphy]
from
soul
asylum
playing
acoustic
shows
where
they'd
just
do
medleys
of
everything
from
the
the
gambler
to
amazing
grace
then
dan
started
doing
things
like
eagles
tribute
nights
with
ponchos
and
buckets
of
fried
chicken
then
we
started
doing
rolling
stones
tributes
and
those
things
got
really
popular
and
that
evolved
into
the
golden
smog
with
so
many
writers
in
the
band
isn't
it
a
bit
like
too
many
cooks
in
the
kitchen?
no
surprisingly
not
people
somehow
just
shift
roles
and
the
spotlight
shifts
over
to
the
respective
songwriter
and
everyone
else
steps
back
into
the
roles
of
sidemen
it
just
automatically
seems
to
do
that
and
i
guess
it's
because
there's
just
such
a
mutual
respect
for
everybody
there's
no
room
for
bad
feelings
in
the
smog
that's
more
for
our
own
bands

no
i'm
just
kidding
(chuckles)
do
you
come
together
with
songs
finished
or
do
you
write
specifically
for
the
smog?
it
depends
until
you
came
along
and
jennifer
save
me
on
this
album
were
both
tried
with
the
jayhawks
on
the
last
record
but
for
one
reason
or
another
they
didn't
work
so
i
shelved
them
and
later
they
worked
with
the
golden
smog
and
vice
versa

i've
taken
songs
to
the
golden
smog
that
were
strong
but
for
some
reason
just
didn't
work
they
just
seem
to
find
their
own
place
do
you
tend
to
pull
your
punches
a
bit

ie
withholding
your
best
songs
for
the
jayhawks
to
get
first
crack
at?
i've
held
a
few
things
back
that
i
thought
were
important
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
there
aren't
priorities
and
i
think
everybody
in
the
golden
smog
if
they
feel
like
they
have
the
gem
of
their
crop
they're
probably
going
to
save
it
for
their
respective
day
jobs
but
people
aren't
always
the
best
judge
of
their
material
so
for
one
reason
or
another
some
of
the
best
songs
you
write
might
end
up
on
a
golden
smog
album
even
though
you
think
you're
saving
your
best
stuff
you
never
know
with
all
the
material
that's
been
written
for
the
band
now
will
there
still
be
room
for
covers?
i
don't
know
we
haven't
played
in
awhile
we
started
this
record
in
january
of
'97
did
two
weeks
and
then
it
took
a
year
for
us
to
schedule
ourselves
so
we
could
all
be
together
again
so
we
finished
it
in
january
of
'98
i
don't
even
remember
what
they
look
like
the
other
guys
i
know
that
we
will
still
do
a
lot
of
covers
because
it's
still
a
lot
of
fun
for
us
but
there
is
a
lot
of
new
material
now
that
we'd
like
to
play
but
it's
an
odd
transition

before
it
was
like
a
fun
party
thing
and
now
we're
serious
so
trying
to
balance
that
on
stage
is
kind
of
difficult
and
it
can
change
the
personality
of
the
band
depending
on
which
night
you
go
so
would
you
be
more
likely
to
cover
something
really
out
there
like
king
crimson's
21st
century
schizoid
man
or
foreigner's
hot
blooded?
uh
hot
blooded
i
think
i'm
probably
the
only
art
rock
guy
in
the
band
and
i'm
a
little
older
actually

i
never
owned
an
aerosmith
record
until
the
early
nineties
when
we
started
having
to
cover
it
so
i
discovered
a
lot
of
crummy
rock
from
playing
with
the
smog
and
learned
to
enjoy
it
do
you
think
you'll
ever
revive
the
eagles
tribute?
i
wasn't
involved
in
that
i
couldn't
even
stomach
that
i've
never
liked
the
eagles
not
even
in
a
funny
way
although

it
might
be
fun
to
play
hotel
california
just
to
see
the
look
on
our
faces
as
we
got
to
the
big
instrumental
part
but
no
that
hasn't
ever
come
up
how
open
are
the
doors
to
golden
smog?
say
if
an
evan
dando
came
knocking

(laughs)
it's
open
but
there's
somewhat
of
a
waiting
list
right
now
i
can't
really
tell
you
who
other
than
that
some
of
the
people
on
the
list
are
actually
much
bigger
than
the
people
in
the
band
but
i
foresee
a
possibility
that
if
this
were
to
continue
and
for
some
reason
somebody
couldn't
make
it
there
could
possibly
be
a
fillin
for
someone
on
a
tour
or
a
record
but
right
now
i'm
really
happy
with
who
we
have
in
the
band
but
who
knows?
maybe
there
will
be
an
east
coast
and
a
west
coast
smog
so
what's
your
take
on
the
supergroup
concept?
i
take
it
you
were
never
an
asia
fan

oh
of
course
not
no
(laughs)
supergroup
conjures
up
to
me
things
from
the
seventies
i
guess
the
one
that
was
maybe
close
to
being
anything
was
maybe
blind
faith
but
usually
you
would
think
of
it
the
way
you
might
think
of
golden
smog
but
you'd
be
wrong

that
is
just
a
bunch
of
guys
getting
together
and
playing
probably
without
a
lot
of
chemistry
and
without
a
lot
of
focus
but
for
some
reason
with
the
golden
smog

and
i
don't
think
it's
because
i'm
prejudice

although
it
may
not
hold
together
as
much
as
one
singer
singing
an
entire
record
it
still
offers
something
else
that
is
equally
as
strong
and
i
don't
know
how
to
explain
it
somehow
it
works
and
that's
the
reason
we
do
it
otherwise
we
wouldn't
embarrass
ourselves
or
try
to
put
out
something
that's
mediocre
plus
we're
not
exactly
household
names
i
remember
reading
some
review
in
england
saying
'i
got
all
this
press
and
who
are
these
guys
with
these
fake
names?
i
was
just
fascinated

and
finally
i
got
the
information
and
i
still
didn't
recognize
anybody's
name
except
dan
murphy
from
soul
asylum'
when
you
think
of
wilco
and
the
jayhawks
and
run
westy
run
and
combine
all
the
record
sales
it's
not
exactly
super
as
far
as
supersuccess
but
i
guess
we're
just
a
super
bunch
of
guys
we're
a
super
good
