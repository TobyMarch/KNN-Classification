biography
death
cab
for
cutie's
rise
from
smalltime
solo
project
to
grammynominated
rock
band
is
one
of
indie
rock's
greatest
success
stories
launched
in
the
bayside
college
town
of
bellingham
washington
the
group
was
originally
a
side
project
for
singer/guitarist
ben
gibbard
an
engineering
student
at
western
washington
university
who
split
his
time
between
school
and
music
taking
a
break
from
his
local
power
pop
band
pinwheel
gibbard
began
recording
an
album's
worth
of
solo
material
during
the
summer
of
1997
producer
chris
walla
lent
his
help
to
the
sessions
which
resulted
in
an
eightsong
cassette
entitled
you
can
play
these
songs
with
chords
when
the
tape
became
a
local
hit
gibbard
reached
into
his
circle
of
friends
to
form
a
band
hoping
to
play
the
new
songs
live
bassist
nick
harmer
(gibbard's
roommate)
and
drummer
nathan
good
climbed
aboard
and
walla
enlisted
as
the
band's
primary
guitarist
(he
would
also
go
on
to
produce
most
of
the
band's
future
releases)
with
a
lineup
now
in
place
gibbard's
group
rechristened
itself
death
cab
for
cutie
(named
after
a
song
by
the
bonzo
dog
doo
dah
band)
and
signed
a
contract
with
the
seattlebased
barsuk
records
within
a
year's
time
the
quartet
made
its
studio
debut
with
1998's
something
about
airplanes
an
album
that
featured
several
rerecorded
tracks
from
the
you
can
play
these
songs
with
chords
cassette
as
well
as
a
dreamy
poporiented
sound
reminiscent
of
built
to
spill
gibbard
and
walla
both
continued
to
pursue
their
own
projects
(including
gibbard's
successful
stint
with
the
postal
service)
but
that
didn't
keep
death
cab
for
cutie
from
returning
to
the
studio
for
a
second
album
we
have
the
facts
and
we're
voting
yes
which
appeared
in
2000
nathan
good
left
the
group
just
prior
to
the
album's
completion
and
we
have
the
facts
introduced
michael
schorr
as
death
cab's
new
drummer
the
forbidden
love
ep
arrived
that
same
year
while
a
third
fulllength
effort
the
photo
album
was
released
in
2001
by
this
time
a
sizable
audience
had
gathered
around
the
band's
emotional
music
and
barsuk
rereleased
you
can
play
these
songs
with
chords
in
2002
with
ten
additional
songs
the
polished
hookladen
transatlanticism
arrived
in
2003
and
announced
the
arrival
of
drummer
jason
mcgerr
who
had
previously
played
in
a
band
with
nick
harmer
before
death
cab's
formation
the
album
also
proved
to
be
a
very
important
step
in
the
band's
career
gathering
positive
attention
from
consumers
and
industry
execs
(including
television
producer
josh
schwartz
who
prominently
featured
the
band's
music
throughout
several
seasons
of
the
oc)
with
their
popularity
at
an
alltime
high
the
bandmates
issued
a

the
band
proceeded
to

the
remainder
of
the
year
while
a
deluxe

packaged
with
a
recording

after
the

completion
after
a
short
hiatus
—
not
to
mention
a

for
ben
gibbard
who
married
actress/musician
zooey
deschanel
—
they
reconvened
for
2011's
codes

found
the
band
relying
less
on
the
electric
guitar
and
more
on
moody
cureinspired
song
textures

(right
