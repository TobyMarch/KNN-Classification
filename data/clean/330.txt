just
as
don
henley's
work
with
the
eagles
in
the
1970s
chronicled
a
culture
that
was
rapidly
spinning
out
of
control
his
'80s
output
cataloged
and
criticized
a
decade
of
greed
cruelty
and
prurient
interest
in
the
misfortune
of
others
but
this
is
music
not
journalism
and
despite
the
overt
seriousness
of
such
songs
as
dirty
laundry
all
she
wants
to
do
is
dance
the
boys
of
summer
and
especially
the
somber
elegiac
the
end
of
the
innocence
henley's
field
reports
were
tuneful
in
the
extreme
the
two
new
tracks
on

fantastic

april

by
brad
formataudio
cd
i
am
a
big
fan
of
don
henley
with
and
without
the
eagles
and
while
his
social
commentaries
do
get
a
bit
tiresome
at
times
there
is
no
denying
the
quality
of
the
music
which
is
the
bottom
line
for
me
from
the
opening
biting
social
commentary
of
dirty
laundry
to
the
closing
unlisted
track
everybody
knows
most
of
these
tracks
are
stellar
the
boys
of
summer
and
the
end
of
the
innocence
are
two
of
don's
biggest
and
best
hits
that
are
of
course
included
here
in
fact
every
top
40
don
solo
song
that
is
not
a
part
of
a
duet
is
here
in
addition
none
of
the
three
new
tracks
are
really
balladsinteresting
since
don
has
had
so
many
great
slower
hits
i
take
exception
to
those
who
think
i
will
not
go
quietly
should
not
be
here
that
is
a
great
hardrocking
track
that
rock
radio
played
a
lot
of
in
the
summer
of
1989
to
me
it
helps
to
show
the
diversity
that
does
in
fact
make
up
don
henley's
great
solo
music
for
sure
you
can't
go
wrong
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
eagles
and/or
don
with
this
collection
while
some
of
his
hits
are
much
better
than
others
this
collection
provides
just
what
a
greatest
hits
collection
should
provideall
the
biggest
hits
along
with
some
great
album
tracks
and
interesting
new
material
definitely
a
recommended
purchase

memorable

april

formataudio
cd
don
henley
is
one
of
my
favorite
male
singers
of
all
time
with
or
without
the
eagles
(which
behind
fleetwood
mac
is
my
favorite
band)
and
a
truly
great
songwriter
littering
his
lyrics
with
wit
and
wisdom
the
boys
of
summer
is
my
alltime
favortie
song
of
any
genre
the
sound
is
the
perfect
soundtrack
for
driving
the
california
coast!
and
the
end
of
the
innocence
is
so
true
an
absolutely
gorgeous
masterpiece
that
manages
to
include
an
important
message
the
collection
only
falters
in
that
it
nearly
draws
exclusively
from
2
albums
with
dirty
laundry
the
sole
representative
from
his
first
solo
effort
in
my
opinion
johnny
can't
read
should
have
been
inluded
over
i
will
not
go
quietly
the
new
songs
offer
little
new
and
pale
next
to
the
classics
so
if
you
are
just
a
casual
fan
this
collection
will
probably
suit
you
and
works
well
as
an
intro
to
don's
amazing
talent
it
leaves
you
craving
more
however
therefore
i
suggest
buying
the
3
proper
cd's
which
ususally
are
bargain
priced
anyway
can't
wait
for
the
latest
don
henley
release
coming
next
month!

cd
this
collection
without
a
doubt
is
one
of
my
favorite
cds
i
own
it
is
always
in
my
car
the
cd
cover
has
even
begun
to
fade
i'm
not
exactly
sure
why
certain
songs
such
as
i
will
not
go
quietly
or
not
enough
love
in
the
world
are
considered
greatest
hits
but
i
enjoy
hearing
them
anyway
of
the
three
newer
songs
garden

cd
don
henley
makes
a
masterpiece
of
his
greatest
hits
and
even
adds
3
new
songs
(2
of
which
i
like
a
lot)
to
the
mix
he
certainly
doesn't
skimp
on
the
good
music
in
this
fine
collection
starting
off
with
dirty
laundry
a
biting
track
about
the
press
he
never
lets
the
listener
down
with
is
fine
material
from
3
albums
my
personal
favorites
from
this
albumthe
end
of
the
innocencea
fantastic
track
new
york
minutea
really
haunting
song
about
rushing
through
life
too
fast
and
not
enough
love
in
the
worldhenley
on
a
falsetto
not
bad
the
new
songs
especially
the
garden
of
allah
(a
really
funny
track)
are
quite
fine
as
well
the
only
thing
that
could
have
made
this
album
better
is
the
inclusion
of
johnny
can't
read
sit
down
you're
rocking
the
boat
and
his
masterpiece
duet
with
patti
smyth
sometimes
love
ain't
enough
still
this
is
a
fine
album
one
of
the
finest
greatest
hits
albums
i've
seen

a

cd
henley`s
solo
collection
is
not
a
mixed
bag
of
music
actual
miles
shines
quality
all
over
from
the
opening
track
dirty
laundry
with
a
very
good
tabloid
critique
of
the
media
society
which
still
holds
up
today
to
the
last
track
this
cd
shinesbut
how
can
you
possible
go
wrong
when
you
move
into
the
boys
of
summer
on
track
2
you
can
realy
feel
the
summer
breeze
shivering
trough
youre
soul
on
this
one
an
open
soundpicture
with
a
somekind
of
air
feel
to
with
it
uplifting
track
4
it`s
not
enough
love
in
this
world
is
also
a
winner
it`s
moody
and
have
enough
tempo
upbeat
to
make
you
a
happier
human
beeing
and
the
lyricks
tell
you
things
to
think
about
too
but
the
real
winner
and
my
old
time
henley
favourite
is
track
6
the
end
of
the
innocence
the
opening
with
the
piano
it`s
pure
music
magic
and
when
henley`s
voice
is
put
in
gear
this
is
what
music
should
be
it`s
like
a
short
movie
in
a
way
just
close
your
eyes
and
listening
anyway
if
you
new
to
henley
this
one
gives
you
an
earopener
when
it
comes
to
pure
gold
quality

formataudio
cd
despite
the
cynical
(and
hilarous)
cover
this
is
really
quite
an
adequate
greatest
hits
albums
it
includes
almost
all
of
the
best
songs
from
don's
solo
career
i
like
don
henley's
music
because
he's
honest
he's
not
fooling
anybody
and
he
tells
you
what
he
really
thinks
in
his
songs
instead
of
just
catering
to
the
audience
like
so
many
others
this
is
rare
in
an
artist
today
you
have
to
dig
through
an
awful
lot
of
boy
bands
and
sellouts
to
get
to
the
don
henleys
roger
waters
and
bruce
springsteens
anyway
this
has
most
of
don's
best
songs
that
are
both
lyrically
cynical
and
honest
as
well
as
still
managing
to
be
melodic
dirty
laundry
the
boys
of
summer
new
york
minute
etc
are
all
great
tracks
and
the
heart
of
the
matter
(one
of
my
favorite
ballads)
the
end
of
the
innocence
and
others
are
flat
out
masterpieces
buy
this
album
if
you
want
a
good
overview
of
don's
solo
career
although
it
is
missing
a
few
songs
which
is
why
i
have
it
4
stars
instead
