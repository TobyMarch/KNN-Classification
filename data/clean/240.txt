biography
boston
united
states
(1970
–
present)
aerosmith
is
a
prominent
american
rock
band
three
of
the
members
steven
tyler
joe
perry
and
tom
hamilton
first
met
in
sunapee
new
hampshire
in
the
late
60’s
but
it
wasn’t
until
1970
in
boston
massachusetts
that
the
three
decided
to
form
a
band
together
later
they
met
up
with
joey
kramer
(drums)
and
brad
whitford
(rhythm
guitar)
the
band
enjoyed
major
popularity
throughout
the
1970’s
with
rock
anthems
like
“dream
on”

but
they
split
from
197984
due
to
serious
substance
abuse
and
drug
addictions
that
contributed
to
their
decline
the
grateful
dead’s
jerry
garcia
reportedly
said
they
were
“the
druggiest
bunch
of
guys
i’ve
ever
seen”
jimmy
crespo
replaced
joe
perry
during
those
five
years
however
in
1984
chiefly
due
to
the
tireless
efforts
of
joe
perry’s
then
manager
tim
collins
to
reform
the
band
aerosmith
was
born
again
despite
his
own
client
perry’s
insistence
that
it
was
unthinkable
collins
succeeded
in
helping
the
band
resolve
old
differences
and
ultimately
overcome
their
addictions
by
1989
the
band
had
completely
stopped
their
drug
abuse
they
went
on
to
enjoy
a
resurgence
in
popularity
that
has
made
them
one
of
topselling
and
most
popular
rock
bands
in
the
world
today
their
greatest
worldwide
hit
was
“i
don’t
want
to
miss
a
thing”
from
the
blockbusterhit
movie
“armageddon”
part
of
that
renewal
came
in
the
form
of
a
1986
collaboration
with
run
dmc
on
a
rock/rap
version
of
walk
this
way
this
song
also
served
as
an
early
step
in
bridging
the
gap
between
the
rap
community
and
rock
and
roll
