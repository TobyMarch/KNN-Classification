gary
allan
herzberg
was
born
and
raised
in
la
mirada
california[1]
to
harley
and
mary
herzberg[2]
to
ensure
that
the
family
would
focus
on
music
allan's
mother
insisted
that
the
family's
guitars
would
always
remain
visible
in
the
home
at
age
thirteen
allan
began
playing
in
honky
tonks
with
his
father[1][3]
two
years
later
he
was
offered
his
first
recording
contract
from
am
records
but
rejected
the
deal
his
parents
wanted
him
to
finish
his
education
and
his
father
felt
that
allan
had
yet
to
develop
his
own
distinctive
style[4]
despite
his
commitment
to
finishing
school
allan
reflects
that
he
was
rarely
alert
in
class
i
played
the
bars
at
night
i
was
half
asleep
when
i
got
to
school
i
thought
sleep
was
what
you
did
when
you
go
to
school[4]
after
graduating
from
la
serna
high
school
in
whittier
california
allan
continued
to
play
in
the
bars
with
his
band
the
honky
tonk
wranglers
many
of
the
venues
they
played
were
packed
and
promoters
often
tried
to
move
them
to
larger
clubs
the
moves
would
have
required
him
to
stop
playing
some
of
the
older
country
music
such
as
covers
of
george
jones
songs
so
allan
refused[3]
in
1987

nashville
connection
[edit]
allan
was
introduced
to
songwriter/producer
byron
hill
on
august
28
1993
by
a
mutual
friend
and
talentscout
jim
seal
at
a
bar
called
the
lion
d'or
in
downey
california
where
allan
was
already
regularly
performing
seal
and
hill
had
asked
allan
if
they
could
showcase
an
unsigned
act
that
they
were
developing
there
hill
had
arranged
to
bring
the
head
of
ar
from
a
major
label
to
the
show
to
see
this
other
act
perform
allan
kindly
let
them
use
his
stage
for
the
event
giving
the
new
act
the
opening
performance
slot
that
night
hill
promised
gary
that
they
would
make
sure
the
ar
person
remained
there
to
see
his
portion
of
the
show
everyone
was
knocked
out
with
allan's
performance
and
very
impressed
with
his
voice
from
that
point
on
byron
hill
began
sending
gary
songs
without
any
serious
funding
at
the
time
hill
arranged
for
allan
to
go
into
seal's
small
studio
in
california
to
try
his
vocals
on
some
of
existing
demo
tracks
that
byron
had
sent
to
gary
from
nashville
tennessee
meanwhile
hill
became
head
of
ar
at
bna
entertainment
on
october
29
of
that
same
year
and
immediately
wanted
to
sign
allan
to
bna
but
the
then
current
roster
conditions
and
other
circumstances
related
to
the
planned
restructuring
of
rca/bna
nashville
stood
in
the
way[9]
from
demo
to
deal
[edit]
in
the
meantime
allan
took
a
job
selling
cars
he
left
a
demo
tape
in
the
glove
box
of
a
truck
purchased
by
a
wealthy
couple
when
the
couple
discovered
that
he
was
the
singer
they
wrote
him
a
check
for
$12000[4]
this
independent
funding
allowed
allan
to
go
to
nashville
to
record
some
of
the
songs
that
were
on
that
early
demo
tape
with
byron
hill
as
producer[9]
on
september
11
1995
they
worked
at
javelina
studios
for
a
couple
of
days
on
the
four
songs
that
hill
immediately
showed
to
labels
allan's
recordings
brought
serious
responses
from
several
labels
including
mercury
rca
and
decca[9]
a
meeting
was
then
held
at
a
nashville
hotel
among
hill
allan
and
friend
of
allan's
who
was
a
program
director
for
a
radio
station
in
california[9]
the
meeting
was
to
arrange
two
showcases
in
los
angeles
california
to
put
allan
on
stage
at
two
of
the
radio
station's
regular
nights
at
a
local
club
byron
arranged
for
staffers
at
the
nashville
office
of
decca
records
to
attend
the
first
showcase
held
on
november
1
1995
decca
immediately
wanted
to
sign
allan
and
knowing
that
byron
was
lining
up
other
labels
to
see
gary
decca
asked
them
to
cancel
the
second
showcase
a
rep
from
rca
was
already
booked
to
see
the
second
showcase
the
following
week
but
the
birdinhand
deal
offer
was
too
tempting
for
both
byron
and
gary
so
they
committed

political
views
[edit]
in
2003
allan
told
cmt
that
he
believed
republican
candidate
arnold
schwarzenegger
would
be
the
best
governor
because
he
is
not
driven
by
money[21]
sound
[edit]
allan's
voice
is
described
as
raspy
and
unpolished[3]
the
new
york
times
describes
his
music
as
elegant
often
deadpan
songs
[that]
tend
toward
manly
understatement[22]
his
sound
is
heavily
influenced
by
the
bakersfield
scene
especially
buck
owens
and
merle
haggard
he
prefers
this
sound
to
that
of
the
more
pop
country
that
is
prevalent
on
country
radio
because
the
songs
have
got
to
have
soul
have
real
meaningcountry
music
iswhat
happens
during
the
week
rock
'n
roll
is
about
what
happens
at
the
weekend[4]
because
his
sound
is
different
from
many
of
the
current
crop
of
country
singers
allan
has
at
times
had
difficulty
getting
radio
to
play
his
singles
he
says
he
has
to
walk
a
real
fine
line
to
make
sure
that
i
get
traditional
stuff
on
the
radio[3]
