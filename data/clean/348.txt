electric
light
orchestra
were
a
symphonic
rock
band
which
formed
in
birmingham
england
in
1970
the
band
was
formed
by
jeff
lynne
(vocals
guitar
multiple
instruments)
roy
wood
(multiple
instruments
vocals)
richard
tandy
(keyboards
vocals)
and
bev
bevan
(drums)
lynne
wood
and
bevan
were
former
members
of
the
psychedelic
rock
band
the
move
the
band’s
lineup
would
fluctuate
throughout
its
original
incarnation
although
lynne
tandy
and
bevan
would
remain
constant
members
they
incorporated
the
sounds
of
string
ensembles
vocoders
and
dub
echos
into
rock
songs
thereby
creating
a
very
sophisticated
studio
version
of
rock
the
musical
content
of
elo
songs
often
went
far
beyond
usual
chord
structures
mixing
pop
songwriting
with
classical
romanticism
and
synthesized
sounds
the
band
claim
that
their
music
“picks
up
where
the
beatles’
1967
song
i
am
the
walrus
left
off”
formed
in
1970
by
roy
wood
jeff
lynne
and
bev
bevan
(the
remaining
members
of
the
1960s
rock
group
the
move)
the
band
used
cellos
violin
horns
and
woodwinds
to
give
their
music
a
classical
sound
this
was
an
idea
roy
wood
initially
had
while
with
the
move
to
take
rock
music
in
a
new
direction
in
1970
when
carl
wayne
left
the
the
move
jeff
lynne
front
man
with
fellow
brum
band
idle
race
responded
to
wood’s
second
invitation
to
join
the
lineup
with
the
lure
of
starting
the
new
band

that's
the
point
they
were
a
big
name
but
now
it's
kind
of
big
deal
when
somebody
knows
them
i
don't
really
know
why
the
world
forgot
about
them
a
bit
they're
a
very
good
band
and
surely
one
of
a
kind
