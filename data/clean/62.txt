cary
brothers
is
a
critically
acclaimed
artist
who
gained
worldwide
recognition
with
his
ballad
“blue
eyes”
which
was
featured
on
the
the
grammywinning
garden
state
soundtrack
he’s
currently
on
the
brink
of
releasing
his
second
album
and
his
new
tracks
“let
me
be”
and
“disappear”
are
already
receiving
lots
of
buzz
(psst!
listen
to
them
here)
his
independent
eps
“all
the
rage”
and
“waiting
for
your
letter”
have
reached
the
top
of
the
itunes
singer/songwriter
charts
from
smallville
to
grey’s
anatomy
to
bones
his
music
has
been
featured
on
almost
every
television
show
you
can
imagine
however
if
there’s
one
claim
to
fame
that
stands
out
about
cary
—
at
least
in
our
perspective
—
it’s
that
his
songs
and
covers
have
been
featured
on
the
vampire
diaries
more
than
any
other
artist
–
six
times
total!
that
being
said
we
knew
it
was
about
high
time
we
reached
out
to
this
talented
fellow
for
a
quick
chat
about
vampires
relationships
and
those
tunes
of
his
that
have
amplified
the
poignancy
of
so
many
heartfelt
mystic
falls
moments
check
out
our
exclusive
interview
with
cary
below!
alloy
entertainment
your
music
has
been
featured
quite
a
few
times
on
the
show!
do
you
watch
tvd?
more
specifically
what
did
you
think
of
the
scene
during
which
“belong”
was
played?
cary
brothers
it
was
pretty
amazing
i’ve
had
songs
used
in
a
lot
of
shows
and
movies
and
rarely
does
it
have
that
kind
of
emotional
impact
i’ve
seen
the
reaction
from
tvd
fans
online
and
i
just
feel
lucky
to
have
my
song
in
there
and
listened
to
by
such
a
passionate
group
of
people
i
found
out
the
other
day
that
it
missed
being
voted
#1
best
song
of
the
tv
season
finales
by
only
a
few
votes
over
at
entertainment
weekly
the
tvd
brigade
really
came
out
to
support
alloy
entertainment
what
is
the
back
story
to
“belong”?
it’s
such
a
hearttugging
track!
cary
brothers
well
i
don’t
really
like
to
talk
too
much
about
songs
because
to
me
what
you
think
the
song
is
about
is
so
much
more
important
than
the
original
intention
who
am
i
to
tell
someone
that
their
interpretation
is
wrong?
once
i
put
a
song
out
in
the
world
it’s
not
mine
anymore
that
being
said…
there
was
a
girl
and
it
didn’t
end
well
alloy
entertainment
you’re
well
known
for
the
beautiful
imagery
in
your
lyrics
do
you
have
a
favorite
lyrical
moment
from
any
of
your
songs?
cary
brothers
picking
favorites
of
songs
is
like
picking
your
favorite
kid
and
i
just
kind
of
like
all
of
them
the
same…
some
for
lyrics
some
for
melodies
and
some
for
how
they
remind
me
of
a
certain
time
of
my
life
they’re
all
moments
of
therapy
for
me
alloy
entertainment
you’ve
collaborated
with
many
talented
artists
including
priscilla
ahn
garrison
star
and
sigur
r&oacutes!
who
else
would
you
love
to
work
with
and
why?
cary
brothers
i
think
the
endall
beall
collaboration
would
be
with
peter
gabriel
i
was
just
listening
to
some
old
unfinished
demos
of
his
songs
and
his
demos
are
better
than
most
new
music
i
hear
today
he
just
has
a
voice
like
magic
or
i
think
it
would
be
fun
to
go
a
little
left
field
and
do
a
giant
dance
pop
song
with
robyn
i’m
very
guilty
of
having
been
busted
singing
“call
your
girlfriend”
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
in
my
car
alloy
entertainment
your
new
ep
is
awesome!
what
sets
your
upcoming
full
release
apart
from
your
other
albums?
cary
brothers
thanks!
the
other
albums
all
came
from
different
life
experiences
and
were
recorded
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
blended
together
to
make
one
single
record
and
the
difficulty
is
making
so
many
different
songs
make
sense
as
one
idea
this
new
ep
“let
me
be”
was
recorded
in
two
days
after
a
difficult
time
in
my
life
of
change
and
it
pretty
much
exists
as
one
idea
it
feels
like
you
can
play
it
beginning
to
end
almost
as
one
long
piece
of
music
i
like
throwing
on
a
record
and
driving
at
night
getting
lost
in
the
music
and
hopefully
this
ep
is
appropriate
for
that
kind
of
thing
alloy
entertainment
you
were
a
crucial
presence
on
the
garden
state
soundtrack
and
we
have
no
doubt
you’ll
be
featured
in
wish
i
was
here
have
you
and
zach
braff
discussed
writing
any
new
tracks
specifically
for
the
film?
cary
brothers
i
can’t
imagine
the
pressure
zach
now
feels
after
having
so
much
success
with
the
first
film
and
that
collection
of
music
mainly
because
its
success
was
so
organic
it
happened
without
any
big
marketing
campaign
like
most
records
these
days
people
just
discovered
it
one
by
one
it
was
like
a
mix
tape
made
by
zach
and
his
friends
over
the
course
of
a
very
musical
summer
and
i
was
so
proud
to
be
chosen
as
a
part
of
that
thing
whatever
happens
with
the
soundtrack
to
wish
i
was
here
i
hope
that
it
has
as
much
impact
but
has
a
very
different
sound
and
introduces
all
new
bands
to
a
wider
audience
i
haven’t
discussed
new
music
with
zach
but
if
i
end
up
having
a
song
on
there
i
imagine
it
will
sound
nothing
the
song
i
had
in
garden
state
alloy
entertainment
if
vampires
were
real
would
you
ever
date
one?
or
would
the
whole
“bloodsucking”
and
“eternity”
aspects
deter
you?
cary
brothers
if
i
were
madly
in
love
with
a
woman
and
she
turned
out
to
be
a
vampire
and
would
stick
by
my
side
while
i
grew
old
and
she
stayed
young
i’m
not
really
sure
how
i
would
turn
that
down
i
could
see
how
the
whole
“her
murdering
people
to
stay
alive”
thing
might
become
a
problem
but
i’ve
dated
some
crazy
girls
before
so
i’m
openminded
alloy
entertainment
and
now
for
the
inevitable
question
—
who
are
your
top
three
favorite
vampires?
cary
brothers
1)
david
(from
the
lost
boys)
–
kiefer
sutherland’s
bleach
blonde
leather
jacketed
motorcycle
vampire
scared
the
crap
outta
me
when
i
was
a
kid
he
was
the
first
vampire
i
saw
that
didn’t
look
like
dracula
he
made
them
seem
more
real
and
kind
of
led
to
all
the
modern
vampires
we
have
today
2)
angel
(from
buffy
the
vampire
slayer)
–
he
was
such
a
good
dude
—
[although]
he
occasionally
went
crazy/bad
and
seriously
messed
people
up
and
who
wouldn’t
wanna
make
out
with
the
hottest
vampire
slayer
in
sunnydale?
3)
it’s
a
tie
pam
(from
true
blood)
–
she
makes
me
laugh
more
than
any
other
vampire

eli
(from
let
the
right
one
in)
–
if
you
haven’t
seen
this
movie
give
it
a
try
almost
a
realistic
depiction
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
a
vampire
in
this
world
and
the
actress
who
plays
eli
is
unbelievably
good
want
to
know
more
about
cary
and
his
incredible
music?
connect
with
him
via
twitter
at
