two
of
the
founding
members
drummer
brian
downey
and
bass
guitarist/vocalist
phil
lynott
met
while
still
in
school
lynott
assumed
the
role
of
frontman
and
led
them
throughout
their
recording
career
of
twelve
studio
albums
thin
lizzy
are
best
known
for
their
songs
whiskey

the
jar
jailbreak
and
the
boys
are
back
in
town
all
major
international
hits
still
played
regularly
on
hard
rock
and
classic
rock
radio
stations
after
lynott's
death
in
1986
various
incarnations
of
the
band
have
emerged
over
the
years
based
initially
around
guitarists
scott
gorham
and
john
sykes
though
sykes
left
the
band
in
2009
gorham
later
continued
with
a
new
lineup
including
downey
lynott
thin
lizzy's
de
facto
leader
was
composer
or
cocomposer
of
almost
all
of
the
band's
songs
and
the
first
black
irishman
to
achieve
commercial
success
in
the
field
of
rock
music
thin
lizzy
boasted
some
of
the
most
critically
acclaimed
guitarists
throughout
their
history
with
downey
and
lynott
as
the
rhythm
section
on
the
drums
and
bass
guitar
as
well
as
being
multiracial
the
band
drew
their
members
not
only
from
both
sides
of
the
irish
border
but
also
from
both
the
catholic
and
protestant
communities
during
the
troubles
their
music
reflects
a
wide
range
of
influences
including
blues
soul
music
psychedelic
rock
and
traditional
irish
folk
music
but
is
generally
classified
as
hard
rock
or
sometimes
heavy
metal
rolling
stone
magazine
describes
the
band
as
distinctly
hard
rock
far
apart
from
the
braying
mid70s
metal
pack[1]
allmusic
critic
john
dougan
has
written
that
as
the
band's
creative
force
lynott
was
a
more
insightful
and
intelligent
writer
than
many
of
his
ilk
preferring
sliceoflife
workingclass
dramas
of
love
and
hate
influenced
by
bob
dylan
van
morrison
bruce
springsteen
and
virtually
all
of
the
irish
literary
tradition[2]
van
morrison
jeff
beck
and
jimi
hendrix
were
major
influences
during
the
early
days
of
the
band
and
later
influences
included
the
pioneering
twin
lead
guitars
found
in
wishbone
ash
and
american
artists
little
feat
and
bob
seger
in
2012
gorham
and
downey
decided
against
recording
new
material
as
thin
lizzy
so
a
new
band
black
star
riders
was
formed
to
tour
and
produce
new
releases
such
as
the
all
hell
breaks
loose
album
thin
lizzy
plan
to
reunite
for
occasional
concerts[3]

[edit]
early
years
(1969–74)
[edit]
thin
lizzy
were
founded
one
night
in
late
december
1969
in
dublin
ireland
when
belfast
guitarist
eric
bell
met
up
with
organist
eric
wrixon
in
a
pub
and
found
that
they
shared
an
ambition
to
form
a
group
both
musicians
had
previously
played
with
them
fronted
by
van
morrison[4]
the
same
night
they
went
to
see
the
band
orphanage
which
featured
vocalist
phil
lynott
and
drummer
brian
downey
bell
and
wrixon
introduced
themselves
after
the
gig
and
suggested
the
four
of
them
form
a
band
together
lynott
and
downey
were
aware
of
bell's
good
musical
reputation[5]
and
agreed
with
the
condition
that
lynott
play
bass
guitar
as
well
as
sing
and
that
they
perform
some
of
his
own
compositions[4]
in
july
1970
thin
lizzy
released
a
single
the
farmer/i
need
you
on
emi
with
the
bside
written
by
john
d'ardis
who
owned
trend
studios
where
the
single
was
recorded
the
single
sold
just
283
copies
and
is
now
a
collectors'
item[4]
wrixon
left
the
band
before
the
single's
release
meaning
there
was
a
greater
share
of
income
for
the
three
remaining
members[5]
he
moved
to
mainland
europe
before
returning
to
belfast
rejoining
his
old
band
them[6]
by
the
end
of
the
year
thin
lizzy
were
signed
to
decca
records
and
they
travelled
to
london
in
january
1971
to
record
their
debut
album
thin
lizzy
the
album
sold
moderately
well
but
did
not
chart
in
the
uk
despite
airplay
and
support
from
influential
djs
john
peel
and
kid
jensen[4]
around
march
1971
the
band
permanently
relocated
to
london
before
the
release
of
the
unsuccessful
new
day
ep
in
august[6]
despite
poor
sales
decca
agreed
to
finance
the
band's
second
album
shades
of
a
blue
orphanage
released
in
march
1972
like
the
previous
lp
the
songs
were
filled
with
lynott's
personal
anecdotes
and
references
to
his
life
in
dublin
and
the
people
he
knew
there
musically
the
style
was
celtic
with
little
warning
of
the
hard
rock
direction
that
the
band
were
to
take
in
the
future[4]
again
the
album
did
not
chart
in
the
uk
in
mid1972
thin
lizzy
were
asked
to
record
an
album
of
deep
purple
covers
which
was
released
under
the
title
funky
junction
play
a
tribute
to
deep
purple
no
mention
was
made
of
thin
lizzy
on
the
record
vocals
and
keyboards
were
handled
by
members
of
another
band
elmer
fudd
and
a
few
instrumental
tracks
composed
by
the
band
were
also
included
on
the
album[5]
the
album
was
released
in
january
1973

in

1972
the
band
embarked
upon
a
highprofile
tour
of
the
uk
with
slade
who
were
enjoying
a
string
of
hit
singles
at
the
time
and
suzi
quatro
around
the
same
time
decca
decided
to
release
thin
lizzy's
version
of
a
traditional
irish
ballad
whiskey
in
the
jar
as
a
single
the
band
was
angry
at
the
release
feeling
that
the
song
did
not
represent
their
sound
or
their
image[6]
but
the
single
topped
the
irish
chart
and
reached
no
6
in
the
uk
in
february
1973
resulting
in
an
appearance
on
top
of
the
pops
it
also
charted
in
many
countries
across
europe
however
the
followup
single
randolph's
tango
was
a
return
to
lynott's
more
obscure
work
and
it
did
not
chart
outside
ireland[7]
the
band's
next
album
vagabonds
of
the
western
world
was
released
in
september
1973
to
positive
reviews
but
again
failed
to
chart[7]
the
accompanying
single
the
rocker
also
found
little
success
outside
ireland
and
the
momentum
gained
from
their
hit
single
was
lost[5]
eric
bell
suddenly
left
the
band
on
new
year's
eve
1973
after
a
gig
at
queen's
university
belfast
due
to
increasing
illhealth
and
disillusionment
with
the
music
industry[5]
and
young
exskid
row
guitarist
gary
moore
was
recruited
to
help
finish
the
tour
moore
stayed
until
april
1974
but
the
band
recorded
three
songs
with
him
in
that
time
including
the
version
of
still
in
love
with
you
that
was
included
on
the
fourth
album
nightlife
with
the
departure
of
moore
thin
lizzy
had
to
recruit
two
temporary
guitarists
to
complete
a
tour
of
germany
exatomic
rooster
guitarist
john
cann
and
berliner
andy
gee
who
had
played
with
peter
bardens
and
ellis
neither
were
considered
as
permanent
members
and
lynott
and
cann
did
not
get
on
well
personally[5]
after
the
tour
and
with
the
contract
with
decca
coming
to
an
end
a
disillusioned
downey
quit
the
band
and
had
to
be
begged
to
return[6]
auditions
were
held
for
new
members
and
lynott
and
downey
eventually
settled
on
glaswegian
guitarist
brian
robertson
who
was
only
17
years
old
at
the
time
and
californian
scott
gorham
the
new
lineup
gelled
quickly
dropped
most
of
the
old
songs
when
they
played
live[6]
and
secured
a
new
record
deal
with
phonogram
but
the
resulting
album
nightlife
was
a
disappointment
for
the
band
due
to
its
soft
production
and
underdeveloped
style[4]
robertson
described
ron
nevison's
production
as
pretty
naff
and
gorham
said
the
record
was
ridiculously
tame[5]
like
the
previous
three
albums
it
failed
to
chart

24
november
1977
in
early
1975
thin
lizzy
toured
the
usa
for
the
first
time
in
support
of
bob
seger
and
bachman–turner
overdrive
when
bto
toured
europe
later
in
the
year
to
support
their
hit
single
you
ain't
seen
nothing
yet
thin
lizzy
again
accompanied
them
on
what
was
a
very
highprofile
tour[5]
they
then
recorded
the
fighting
album
which
became
the
first
thin
lizzy
album
to
chart
in
the
uk
reaching
no
60
although
the
singles
still
did
not
chart
it
showed
the
first
real
evidence
of
the
twin
guitar
sound
that
would
lead
the
band
towards
their
greatest
successes
particularly
with
the
dual
harmonies
of
wild
one
and
both
guitarists'
soloing
on
suicide[4]
after
a
successful
multiband
tour
in
support
of
status
quo
the
band
recorded
the
album
jailbreak
which
proved
to
be
their
breakthrough
record
released
on
26
march
1976
it
featured
the
worldwide
hit
the
boys
are
back
in
town
which
reached
no
8
in
the
uk
and
no
12
in
the
us[8]
their
first
charting
record
in
that
country
the
twin
guitar
sound
had
been
fully
developed
by
this
time
and
was
in
evidence
throughout
the
album
particularly
on
the
hit
single
and
other
tracks
such
as
emerald
and
warriors
the
album
also
charted
well
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
and
the
followup
single
jailbreak
also
performed
well
thin
lizzy
toured
the
us
in
support
of
various
bands
such
as
aerosmith
rush
and
reo
speedwagon
and
they
planned
to
tour
there
again
in
june
1976
this
time
with
rainbow
however
lynott
fell
ill
with
hepatitis
and
the
tour
was
cancelled
which
set
them
back
a
few
months[4]
while
lynott
was
ill
he
wrote
most
of
the
following
album
johnny
the
fox
the
album
was
recorded
in
august
1976
and
the
sessions
began
to
reveal
tensions
between
lynott
and
robertson
for
example
there
was
disagreement
over
the
composition
credits
of
the
hit
single
don't
believe
a
word[5]
lynott
was
still
drawing
on
celtic
mythology
and
his
own
personal
experiences
for
lyric
ideas
which
dominated
johnny
the
fox
and
the
other
albums
of
thin
lizzy's
successful
mid1970s
period[4]
the
tour
to
support
the
album
was
very
successful
and
there
were
further
highprofile
tv
appearances
such
as
the
rod
stewart
bbc
tv
special[6]
a
further
tour
of
the
usa
was
planned
for
december
1976
but
it
had
to
be
cancelled
when
on
23
november
brian
robertson
suffered
a
hand
injury
when
trying
to
protect
fellow
glaswegian
singer
and
friend
frankie
miller
in
a
fracas
at
the
speakeasy
club
in
london
miller
had
been
jamming
onstage
with
the
reggae
band
gonzalez
but
had
been
drunk
offending
gonzalez
guitarist
gordon
hunte
hunte
attacked
miller
with
a
bottle
in
the
dressing
room
and
robertson
intervened
suffering
artery
and
nerve
damage
to
his
hand[5][6]
robertson
subsequently
broke
hunte's
leg
broke
the
collarbone
of
another
man
and
headbutted
another
before
being
hit
on
the
head
with
a
bottle
rendering
him
unconscious[5]
robertson
maintains
that
contrary
to
reports
at
the
time
he
was
not
drunk
and
had
only
gone
to
the
venue
for
a
meal[4][5]
lynott
was
angry
and
replaced
robertson
with
gary
moore
for
another
tour
of
the
states
in
january–march
1977
this
time
supporting
queen
the
tour
was
a
success
and
lynott
asked
moore
to
stay
on
but
he
returned
to
his
previous
band
colosseum
ii
robertson
had
not
been
sacked
but
was
unsure
of
his
position
and
made
plans
to
start
another
band
with
jimmy
bain
of
rainbow[5]
before
the
american
tour
lynott
had
also
invited
irish
guitarist
jimi
slevin
to
try
out
a
few
things
with
thin
lizzy
prompting
speculation
that
the
exskid
row
member
could
replace
robertson[9]
thin
lizzy
flew
to
canada
in
may
1977
as
a
trio
to
record
bad
reputation
with
gorham
handling
all
the
guitar
parts
a
month
into
the
sessions
robertson
joined
them
in
his
own
words
as
a
session
player[4]
and
in
lynott's
words
as
a
guest[6]
robertson
added
lead
guitar
tracks
to
three
songs
as
well
as
rhythm
guitar
and
keyboards
and
was
officially
reinstated
in
july
the
album
was
released
in
september
and
sold
well
reaching
no
4
in
the
uk
after
a
successful
single
dancing
in
the
moonlight
(it's
caught
me
in
its
spotlight)
also
in
1977
thin
lizzy
headlined
the
reading
festival

return
of

8
august
1977
robertson
lynott
gorham
downey
in
1978
lizzy
released
their
first
live
album
live
and
dangerous
there
is
some
disagreement
over
just
how
much
of
the
album
is
actually
recorded
live
–
producer
tony
visconti
claimed
that
the
only
parts
that
weren't
overdubbed
were
the
drums
and
the
audience
however
brian
robertson
has
disputed
this
saying
that
he
had
refused
lynott's
request
to
rerecord
a
guitar
solo
and
that
the
only
overdubs
were
backing
vocals
and
some
guitar
parts
by
gorham
he
added
it's
just
not
true
the
only
reason
we
said
that
it
was
recorded
all
over
was
obviously
for
tax
reasons
so
everything
that
visconti
claims
is
bollocks[4]
the
album
was
a
huge
success
reaching
no
2
in
the
uk
and
was
ranked
as
the
best
live
album
of
all
time
by
classic
rock
magazine
in
2004[10]
but
this
success
was
overshadowed
by
the
permanent
departure
of
robertson
some
time
after
a
gig
in
ibiza
on
6
july
1978
the
disagreements
with
lynott
having
developed
to
an
impossible
level[6]
robertson
soon
teamed
up
with
jimmy
bain
to
front
their
new
band
wild
horses
lynott
replaced
robertson
with
gary
moore
again
and
around
this
time
the
band
loosely
joined
forces
with
steve
jones
and
paul
cook
of
the
sex
pistols
and
also
chris
spedding
and
jimmy
bain
to
form
the
greedy
bastards
who
played
a
small
number
of
gigs
playing
a
varied
selection
of
songs
in
this
way
lynott
was
able
to
align
his
band
with
the
punk
movement
and
avoid
being
tagged
as
a
'dinosaur'
as
many
other
1970s
rock
bands
had
been[5]
in
august
the
band
began
another
tour
of
the
usa
followed
by
a
trip
to
australia
and
new
zealand
brian
downey
did
not
accompany
them
having
contracted
pneumonia
and
preferring
to
spend
some
time
in
ireland
he
was
replaced
for
the
tour
by
american
drummer
mark
nauseef[6]
on
their
return
downey
rejoined
the
band
and
at
the
beginning
of
1979
they
recorded
black
rose
a
rock
legend
in
paris
the
sessions
were
marked
by
the
increasing
drug
habits
of
lynott
and
gorham
and
the
general
presence
of
drugs
around
the
band[5]
this
also
showed
in
the
subject
matter
on
the
album
in
songs
such
as
got
to
give
it
up
celtic
influences
remained
however

were
successful
and
the
album
reached
no

in
the
uk[11]
a
third
moderately
successful
single
sarah
was
lynott's
ode
to
his
newborn
daughter[7]
however
on
4
july
1979
gary
moore
abruptly
left
thin
lizzy
in
the
middle
of
another
tour
of
the
usa
years
later
moore
said
he
had
no
regrets
about
walking
out
but
maybe
it
was
wrong
the
way
i
did
it
i
could've
done
it
differently
i
suppose
but
i
just
had
to
leave[5]
he
subsequently
pursued
his
solo
career
releasing
several
successful
albums
he
had
collaborated
with
lynott
and
downey
on
his
1978
album
back
on
the
streets
and
the
hit
single
parisienne

before
leaving

and
in

he
and

teamed
up
again

aged
58[12][13]
after
moore's
departure
thin
lizzy
continued
the
tour
for
a
few
nights
as
a
trio
before
lynott
brought
in
midge

to
replace
him
on
a
temporary
basis
ure
had
prior
plans
to
join
ultravox
but
had
cowritten
a
song
get
out

here
with
lynott
on
black
rose
a
rock
legend
and
agreed
to
help
thin
lizzy
complete
their
touring
commitments[4]
he
also
contributed
guitar
parts
for
the
continuing
saga
of
the
ageing
orphans

of
remixed
and
overdubbed
versions
of

the
band
headlined
the
leeds
festival
for
the
second
time
in
1979
before
a
tour
of
japan
beginning
in
september
lynott
decided
to
bring
in
another
guitarist
dave
flett
who
had
played
with
manfred
mann's
earth
band
to
enable
ure
to
switch
to
playing
keyboards
where
necessary
the
tour
was
completed
successfully
but
the
lineup
now
contained
two
temporary
members
and
lynott
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
on
projects
outside
thin
lizzy
including
composing
and
producing
material
for
other
bands
as
well
as
putting
together
his
first
solo
album
solo
in
soho[5]
lynott
also
reactivated
the
greedy
bastards
who
released
a
oneoff
christmas
single
a
merry
jingle
in
december
1979
as
simply
the
greedies
with
the

now
composed
of

gorham
and
downey
with

while
lynott
searched
for
a
permanent

he
and
the
other
members
of
thin

past
and
present
worked
on
solo
in
soho
which
was
released
in
april
1980
and
the
next
thin

album
chinatown
lynott
got
married
on
14
february
and
his
wife
gave
birth
to
a
second
daughter
in
july[14]
dave
flett
had
hoped
to
be
made
a
permanent
member
of
thin
lizzy
but
lynott
chose
snowy
white
who
had
played
with
pink
floyd
and
peter
green[4]
midge
ure
was
still
acting
as
a
temporary
keyboard
player
at
gigs
during
early
1980
but
was
replaced
by
darren
wharton
in
april
shortly
after
white
joined
the
band
wharton
was
only
17
at
the
time
and
was
initially
hired
on
a
temporary
basis[4]
this
new
lineup
completed
the
chinatown
album
between
short
tours
and
two
singles
were
released
from
it
the
first
chinatown
reached
no
21
in
the
uk
but
the
second
killer
on
the
loose
reached
the
top
10
amid
much
adverse
publicity
due
to
the
ongoing
activities
of
serial
killer
peter
sutcliffe
known
as
the
yorkshire
ripper[6]
chinatown
was
finally
released
in
october
1980
and
reached
no
7
in
the
uk
but
by
this
time
thin
lizzy
albums
were
not
even
reaching
the
top
100
in
the
usa
after
a
successful
tour
of
japan
and
australia
the
band
undertook
what
was
to
be
their
final
tour
of
the
usa
in
late
1980[4]
at
the
beginning
of
1981
lynott
began
work
on
his
second
solo
album
using
thin
lizzy
members
among
a
large
group
of
backing
musicians
around
the
same
time
the
band
were
recording
material
for
the
next
thin
lizzy
album
and
as
before
the
sessions
seemed
to
merge
to
the
extent
that
musicians
were
not
always
sure
which
album
they
were
working
on
producer
for
the
thin
lizzy
sessions
chris
tsangarides
stated
the
feeling
of
confusion
was
in
the
air
in
that
sometimes
nobody
knew
if
they
were
working
on
a
phil
solo
record
or
a
lizzy
album[4]
snowy
white
had
previously
felt
that
as
a
member
of
thin
lizzy
he
should
have
been
paid
as
a
session
player
to
appear
on
lynott's
solo
recordings[5]
in
april
1981
the
band's
first
'greatest
hits'
album
was
released
and
the
adventures
of
thin
lizzy
reached
no
6
in
the
uk
although
a
standalone
single
trouble
boys
only
reached
no
53
the
band's
worst
chart
placing
since
1975[6]
according
to
white[4]
and
wharton[5]
lynott
was
the
only
person
who
wanted
to
release
it
and
nobody
else
liked
the
song
trouble
boys
had
even
been
pencilled
in
as
the
title
for
the
new
album
but
the
single's
chart
failure
resulted
in
the
song
being
dropped
from
the
album
and
the
title
changed
to
renegade[4]
one
highlight
for
the
band
at
this
time
was
headlining
the
firstever
slane
castle
concert
on
16
august
with
support
from
kirsty
mccoll
hazel
o'connor
and
u2[4]
lynott's
second
solo
album
the
philip
lynott
album
was
delayed
until
1982
while
renegade
was
completed
and
released
in
november
1981
renegade
was
not
successful
only
reaching
no
38
in
the
uk
and
no
157
in
the
us[4]
a
single
hollywood
(down
on
your
luck)
also
flopped[7]
although
it
did
reach
no
24
on
the
us
mainstream
rock
chart[15]
despite
only
two
songs
from
the
album
being
written
solely
by
lynott
and
other
members
of
the
band
contributing
more
to
the
compositions
both
gorham
and
wharton
have
since
stated
their
dissatisfaction
with
some
of
the
songs
such
as
angel
of
death
fats
and
mexican
blood[5]
wharton
was
omitted
from
the
band
photos
on
the
back
of
the
record
sleeve
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
by
this
time
a
permanent
member
of
the
band
it
hurt
me
a
great
deal

performing

showing
their
famous
dual
guitars
on
each
side
the
beginning
of
1982
was
marred
by
both
downey
and
gorham
having
to
take
breaks
from
the
european
tour
to
recover
from
personal
problems
downey
was
involved
in
a
fight
in
a
nightclub
in
denmark
in
february[4]
and
gorham
was
suffering
from
druginduced
exhaustion[6]
downey
missed
five
concerts
and
was

again
for
three
of
them

by

the
lookalikes
for
the
other
two[16]
in

gorham
collapsed
and
returned
home
eight
concerts
were
performed
as
a
quartet
and
six
others
were
postponed[16]
later
in
the
year
lynott
went
on
a
solo
tour
and
released
his
second
solo
album
which
did
not
sell
particularly
well
snowy
white
left
the
band
in
august
1982
having
tired
of
the
disorganised
schedules
and
lynott's
drug
problems
although
by
his
own
admission
he
was
too
restrained
and
quiet
to
fit
in
well
with
his
more
raucous
bandmates[17]
white
went
on
to
achieve
top
ten
chart
success
in
the
uk
with
his
single
bird
of
paradise
in
1983
longtime
comanager
chris

also
left
at
this
time
later
stating
a
oncebrilliant
band
was
turning
to
crap
before
my
very
eyes[5]
lynott
wanted
to
find
a
replacement
for
white
before
starting
to
record
the
next
album
which
would
turn
out
to
be
the
band's
last
by
september
1982
he
had
settled
on
john
sykes
who
had
been
a
member
of
tygers
of
pan
tang
and
he
cowrote
the
first
single
from
the
album
cold
sweat
although
the
rest
of
the
album
had
already
been
written
thunder
and
lightning
was
released
in
march
1983
and
was
much
more
successful
than
its
predecessor
reaching
no
4
in
the
uk[7]
sykes'
presence
had
rejuvenated
the
band
musically
the
composing
credits
were
evenly
shared
and
the
style
had
grown
much
heavier
veering
towards
heavy
metal[4]
the
tour
to
support
the
album
was
to
be
a
farewell
tour
although
lynott
was
not
convinced
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
the
band
sykes
wanted
to
continue
although
gorham
had
had
enough[5]
the
tour
was
successful
and
some
concerts
were
recorded
to
compile
a
live
album
partway
into
the
tour
many
of
thin
lizzy's
past
guitarists
were
invited
onstage
to
contribute
to
some
of
the
songs
they
had
originally
recorded
the
only
exception
being
snowy
white
the
album
was
released
in
october
1983
as
life
which
included
an
older
performance
of
renegade
featuring
white
and
reached
no
29
in
the
uk[7]
the
tour
continued
while
two
more
singles
were
released
the
last
of
them
the
sun
goes
down
only
reaching
no
52
in

lynott
also
undertook
another
solo
tour
accompanied
by
downey
and
sykes
under
the
name
of
the
three
musketeers[4]
after
a
difficult
leg
of
the
tour
in

where
some
members
of

had
difficulty
obtaining

and
split
by
the
beginning
of

sykes
and

agreed
to
be
a
part
of

but
sykes
joined

and
downey
also
changed
his
mind
lynott
began
to
focus
more
on

career
and
enjoyed

[edit]
the
reformed
version
of
thin
lizzy
at
gods
of
metal
2007
in
1996
john
sykes
decided
to
reactivate
thin
lizzy
presenting
the
band
as
a
tribute
to
phil
lynott's
life
and
work[22]
he
decided
to
take
on
the
role
of
lead
vocals
himself
in
the
absence
of
lynott
and
persuaded
scott
gorham
brian
downey
and
darren
wharton
to
return
to
the
fold
to
complete
the
lineup
marco
mendoza
continued
in
lynott's
role
as
bass
player
they
received
criticism
for
using
the
thin
lizzy
name
without
lynott
being
present[4]
but
the
band
only
played
hits
from
thin
lizzy's
back
catalogue
and
did
not
compose
any
new
material[22]
in
1997
tommy
aldridge
filled
in
on
drums
when
brian
downey
was
unable
to
and
became
a
full
member
when
downey
left
shortly
thereafter
this
lineup
remained
stable
through
to
2000
when
the
group
recorded
a
live
album
one
night
only
the
band
went
on
to
tour
the
us
playing
clubs
in
early
2001
but
wharton
had
already
left
the
band
by
the
time
of
the
tour
from
2000
to
2003
mendoza
toured
with
ted
nugent
and
with
whitesnake
in
2004
sykes
released
two
solo
albums
in
the
gap
in
between
2002–03
while
gorham
worked
with
his
band
21
guns
wharton
later
stated
that
thin
lizzy
would
have
been
better
suited
to
playing
fewer
concerts
in
bigger
venues
he
also
felt
that
after
the
experience
of
fronting
his
own
band
dare
it
was
not
satisfying
enough
to
play
keyboards
behind
gorham
and
sykes[23]
sykes
said
that
all
the
previous
thin
lizzy
members
were
welcome
to
play
with
thin
lizzy
at
any
time[24]
in
2004
thin
lizzy
worked
together
again
with
sykes
and
gorham
bringing
in
exangel
bassist
randy
gregg
and
drummer
michael
lee
who
had
played
with
robert
plant
and
the
cult
among
others
they
toured
in
north
america
in
both
the
winter
and
then
the
summer
as
special
guests
of
deep
purple
this
lineup
proved
temporary
however
with
mendoza
returning
in
2005
and
aldridge
returning
in
2007
there
were
no
plans
for
a
new
album
though
thin
lizzy
continued
to
tour
at
the
london
hammersmith
apollo
concert
of
13
december
2007
the
lineup
was
sykes
gorham
aldridge
and
francesco
dicosmo
on
bass[25]
sykes
stated
that
thin
lizzy
was
now
more
of
a
tribute
thing[22]
and
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
record
new
material
under
that
name
he
added
that
while
the
existing
band
members
might
record
together
it
would
not
be
as
thin
lizzy[22]
in
2007
gorham
said
that
lynott
still
received
the
biggest
cheer
of
the
night
at
concerts
and
that
the
current
thin
lizzy
was
not
active
simply
for
money[26]
we'd
stop
if
we
thought
we
were
just
going
through
the
motions
i
think
that
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
songs
–
if
they
were
inferior
then
maybe
we
would
have
got
tired
of
it
all
but
they're
not
and
we
haven't
he
said[26]
in
january
2011
gorham
maintained
that
lynott
would
have
approved
of
the
continuation
of
the
band
he
worked
long
hours
and
travelled
thousands
of
miles
to
get
it
to
a
certain
level
there's
no
way
he
would
have
said
'noone
should
play
those
songs
again'[27]

gorham
stated
that

thin
lizzy's
future
plans
shortly
in
a
statement
he
said
it's
been
a
very
tough
time
of
late
for
myself
and
the
band
firstly
with
drummer
tommy
aldridge's
injury
and
now
the
subsequent
decision
for
john
and
the
rest
of
the
group
to
go
their
separate
ways
i
can
only
apologise
to
everyone
who
has
supported
us
over

up

the

in

2011
at

festival
in
march
2011
gorham
told
billboardcom
that
thin
lizzy
may
record
a
new
album
in
the
future
saying
that's
the
no&nbsp1
question
we're
getting
from
people
–
are
we
gonna
record
some
new
material?
the
fans
seem
to
trust
this
lineup
and
i
don't
blame
them
we've
kind
of
jumped
this
emotional
hurdle
together
ricky's
writing
some
fucking
killer
lyrics
and
with
the
kind
of
talent
that's
in
thin
lizzy
now
i
think
we
can
pull
off
a
really
cool
set
of
tunes
at
least
it's
something
that
we
can
think
about
now
where
before
it
wasn't
on
the
table[32]
on
25
june
2012
thin
lizzy
were
in

would
be
recorded

released[33]

october
2012
thin
lizzy
announced
that
the
new

under
the
thin
lizzy
name
but
would
be
released
under
a
different
name
in
due
course
according
to
gorham
this
was
out
of
respect
to
phil
lynott
and
the
legacy
he
created
though
he
confirmed
that
the
new
material
would
feature
the
classic
thin
lizzy
sound[34]
ricky
warwick
announced
that
the
group
would
cease
regular
touring
as
thin
lizzy
at
the

that
this
did
not
necessarily
mean
they
would
never
play
as
thin
lizzy
again[34]

origin
of
the
band
name
[edit]
the
band's
original
guitarist
eric
bell
who
was
a
fan
of
john
mayall

the
bluesbreakers
bought
a
copy
of
the
dandy
comic[43]
after
seeing
eric
clapton
depicted
reading
a
copy
of
its
sister
publication
the
beano
on
the
cover
of
the
1966
album
bluesbreakers
with
eric
clapton
he
suggested
tin
lizzie
the
name
of
a
robot
character
from
the
comic
itself
named
for
the
common
nickname
for
the
iconic
ford
model
t
car
bell
also
suggested
they
change
'tin'
to
'thin'
to
play
on
the
irish
accent's
propensity
to
drop
the
'h'
after
a
while
lynott
and
downey
agreed
to
the
idea
and
the
name
stuck
as
they
thought
the
confusion
was
amusing
and
would
create
a
talking
point[5][6]
for
some
of
their
early
gigs
the
band
were
mistakenly
promoted
as
tin

switched
from
using

to

though

had
earlier

thin
lizzy
are
widely
recognised
as
one
of
the
first
hard

bands
to
employ
double
lead
guitar
harmony
sound
–
a
technique
pioneered
by

whilst
independently
in

by

this
style
was
later
refined
and
popularised
in

by
bands
like

by
