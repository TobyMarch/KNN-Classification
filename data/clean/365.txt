long

the

the
thunderous
“dirty

lou

tells

about
the
writing
and
recording
of
the
track
that
had
the
greatest
impact
on
his
career
waiting
for
a
girl
like
you
it
was
kept
from
the
top
spot
in
1982
by
olivia
newtonjohn's
physical
something
which
left
gramm
with
a
little
sour
taste
but
it
nonetheless
led
to
more
foreigner
ballads
not
an
easy
transition

a
