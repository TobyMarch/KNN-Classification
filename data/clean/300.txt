music
biography
at
a
time
when
rock
was
evolving
away
from
the
forces
that
had
made
the
music
possible
in
the
first
place
creedence
clearwater
revival
brought
things
back
to
their
roots
with
their
concise
synthesis
of
rockabilly
swamp
pop
rb
and
country
though
the
music
of
ccr
was
very
much
a
group
effort
in
their
tight
punchy
arrangements
their
vision
was
very
much
singer
songwriter
guitarist
and
leader
john
fogerty's
fogerty's
classic
compositions
for
creedence
both
evoked
enduring
images
of
americana
and
reflected
burning
social
issues
of
the
day
the
band's
genius
was
their
ability
to
accomplish
this
with
the
economic
primal
power
of
a
classic
rockabilly
ensemble
the
key
elements
of
creedence
had
been
woodshedding
in
bar
bands
for
about
a
decade
before
their
breakthrough
to
national
success
in
the
late
'60s
john's
older
brother
tom
formed
the
blue
velvets
in
the
late
'50s
in
el
cerrito
california
a
tiny
suburb
across
the
bay
from
san
francisco
by
the
mid'60s
with
a
few
hopelessly
obscure
recordings
under
their
belt
the
band
—
including
tom
and
john
with
two
highschool
friends
drummer
doug
clifford
and
bassist
stu
cook
—
signed
to
fantasy
releasing
several
singles
as
the
golliwogs
that
went
nowhere
in
fact
there's
little
promise
to
be
found
on
those
early
efforts
they
were
extremely
derivative
of
the
british
invasion
and
other
rb
and
rock
trends
of
the
day
with
few
hints
of
the
swampy
roots
rock
that
would
characterize
ccr
the
group
only
found
themselves
when
john
took
firm
reins
over
the
band's
direction
singing
and
writing
virtually
all
of
their
material
on
their
first
album
1968's
creedence
clearwater
revival
the
group
played
it
both
ways
offering
extended
quasipsychedelic
workouts
of
the
'50s
classics
i
put
a
spell
on
you
and
suzieq
the
latter
song
became
their
first
big
hit
but
the
band
didn't
really
bloom
until
proud
mary
a
number
two
single
in
early
1969
that
demonstrated
john's
talent
at
tapping
into
southern
roots
music
and
imagery
with
a
natural
ease
it
was
the
start
of
a
torrent
of
classic
hits
from
the
gritty
little
richardinspired
singer
over
the
next
two
years
including
bad
moon
rising
green
river
down
on
the
corner
travelin'
band
who'll
stop
the
rain
up
around
the
bend
and
lookin'
out
my
back
door
creedence
also
made
good
albums
—
green
river
willy
and
the
poor
boys
and
cosmo's
factory
all
rank
among
the
best
of
the
rock
era
—
but
their
true
forte
was
as
a
singles
band
when
the
beatles
broke
up
in
early
1970
ccr
was
the
only
other
act
that
provided
any
competition
in
the
fine
art
of
crafting
bold
supercatchy
artistic
statements
that
soared
to
the
upper
reaches
of
the
charts
every
three
or
four
months
although
they
hailed
from
the
san
francisco
area
they
rarely
succumbed
to
the
psychedelic
indulgences
of
the
era
john
fogerty
also
proved
adept
at
voicing
the
concerns
of
the
working
class
in
songs
like
fortunate
son
as
well
as
partying
with
as
much
funk
as
any
white
rock
band
would
muster
on
travelin'
band
and
down
on
the
corner
with
john
fogerty
holding
such
a
strong
upper
hand
creedence
couldn't
be
said
to
have
been
a
democratic
unit
and
fogerty's
dominance
was
to
sow
the
seeds
of
the
group's
quick
dissolution
tom
fogerty
left
in
1971
(recording
a
few
unremarkable
solo
albums
of
his
own)
reducing
the
band
to
a
trio
john
allowed
drummer
doug
clifford
and
bassist
stu
cook
equal
shares
of
songwriting
and
vocal
time
on
the
group's
final
album
mardi
gras
(1972)
which
proved
conclusively
that
fogerty's
songs
and
singing
were
necessary
to
raise
ccr
above
journeyman
status
it
was
john
fogerty
of
course
who
produced
the
only
notable
work
after
the
quartet
broke
up
even
his
solo
outings
though
were
erratic
and
for
nearly
ten
years
nonexistent
as
he
became
embroiled
in
a
web
of
business
disputes
with
fantasy
records
his
1984
album
centerfield
proved
he
could
still
rock
in
the
vintage
creedence
mode
when
the
spirit
moved
him
but
tom
fogerty's
death
in
1990
ended
any
hopes
of
a
ccr
reunion
with
the
original
members
intact
