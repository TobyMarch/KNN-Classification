music
gary
louris
impishly
posed
this
question
to
a
guest
tim
oreagan
halfway
through
golden
smogs
concert
on
sunday
night
at
webster
hall
mr
louris
was
alluding
to
the
jayhawks
a
group
he
disbanded
last
year
that
featured
himself
on
guitar
and
lead
vocals
and
mr
oreagan
on
drums
the
audience
well
stocked
with
longtime
jayhawks
fans
had
no
problem
picking
up
on
the
joke
if
thats
what
it
was
golden
smog
should
feel
like
something
other
than
a
consolation
prize
while
it
does
feature
three
exjayhawks

mr
louris
the
bassist
marc
perlman
and
the
guitarist
kraig
jarret
johnson

its
ranks
also
include
dan
murphy
a
guitarist
formerly
with
soul
asylum
and
jeff
tweedy
the
lead
singer
of
wilco
often
pegged
as
an
altcountry
supergroup
golden
smog
traces
its
origins
to
the
late1980s
minneapolis
rock
scene
though
not
a
continuous
project
over
the
years
it
has
established
its
own
glow
as
it
proved
recently
with
the
album
another
fine
day
(lost
highway)
but
sundays
concert
had
a
decidedly
postjayhawks
sensibility
partly
because
mr
tweedy
wasnt
there
as
a
destabilizing
force
oddly
mr
louris
didnt
do
much
to
dispel
this
impression
neither
did
mr
oreagan
who

before
sitting
in
with
golden
smog
on
jennifer
save
me
one
of
the
concerts
better
moments

opened
the
show
with
his
own
band
singing
and
playing
guitar
in
a
set
that
included
a
couple
of
his
songs
for
the
jayhawks
like
tampa
to
tulsa
there
were
moments
when
golden
smog
broke
away
from
old
memories
usually
when
someone
other
than
mr
louris
took
the
lead
beautiful
mind
was
one
strong
example
it
began
with
a
warped
keyboard
drone
and
plunged
into
thudding
darkness
with
ardent
lead
vocals
by
mr
johnson
hurricane
composed
and
sung
by
mr
murphy
made
the
most
of
its
new
wave
tumult
the
bands
touring
drummer
sim
cain
pounded
gleefully
at
his
toms
on
a
few
songs
including
the
breezy
52202
the
band
had
additional
help
from
a
brassandsaxophone
section
introduced
by
mr
louris
as
the
gowanus
horns
golden
smog
prizes
a
garagelike
scrappiness
even
though
its
vocal
harmonies
suggest
something
more
polished
you
know
we
started
out
as
a
cover
band
mr
murphy
pointed
out
just
before
a
respectable
rendition
of
starman
by
david
bowie
other
covers
in
the
set
included
three
dog
nights
easy
to
be
hard
the
rolling
stones
backstreet
girl
and
a
bit
more
unfortunately
led
zeppelins
whole
lotta
love
the
stones
and
zeppelin
covers
came
as
encores
after
one
of
the
quietest
and
most
gripping
moments
of
the
show
a
song
called
listen
joe
that
mr
louris
performed
alone
on
an
acoustic
guitar
(on
the
album
its
a
duet
with
mr
tweedy)
just
before
that
the
full
band
had
romped
through
corvette
a
tune
written
for
a
car
commercial
the
dream
is
never
over
mr
louris
sang
in
a
powerpop
chorus
and
it
wasnt
hard
to
picture
the
jayhawks
fans
in
the
crowd
wanting
to
take
him
at
his
word

smog
and

oreagan
