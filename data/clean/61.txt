about
the
song
belong
performed
by
cary
brothers
delena
(tvd)
represents
some
of
the
lyrics
of
this
song
on
damon's
part
he
is
so
confused
(what
i'd
give
for
that
first
night
when
you
were
mine
thought
you
were
mine)
about
where
he
stands
in
elena's
life
anyway
i
just
thought
they
chose
the
right
soundtracks
in
4x23
graduation
in
the
vampire
diaries
such
a
good
song
