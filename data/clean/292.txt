cd
buffalo
springfield
was
a
band
more
known
for
what
it's
members
did
after
they
left
than
the
great
music
they
made
as
this
short
lived
group
although
only
together
18
months
they
were
the
blueprint
for
some
of
the
most
successful
country
rock
bands
to
come
such
as
csn
poco
and
the
eagles
along
with
about
every
other
west
coast
rock
group
the
songs
on
this
retrospective
which
originally
came
out
in
1969
just
after
their
breakup
were
written
by
either
steven
stills
or
neil
young
the
lone
exception
being
kind
woman
which
was
penned
by
richie
furay
who
later
recorded
it
again
with
his
band
poco
the
first
song
here
and
probably
their
most
famous
single
for
what
it's
worth
established
steven
stills
as
a
great
songwriter
it
also
had
that
catchphrase
in
it
there's
something
happening
here/what
it
is
ain't
exactly
clear
which
was
a
popular
line
in
60's
counterculture
at
the
time
another
great
stills
song
is
bluebird
which
features
some
nice
guitar
work
it
starts
out
as
an
all
out
rock
song
then
comes
that
famous
guitar
interlude
and
then
switches
gears
and
becomes
a
banjo
driven
country
song
absolutely
brilliant!
not
to
be
outdone
is
neil
young
he
pens
3
great
tunes
in
a
row
starting
with
on
the
way
home
i
love
this
song
with
it's
horn
arrangements
it's
different
than
any
other
buffalo
song
nowadays
clancy
can't
even
sing
is
a
beautiful
folk
rock
song
with
csn
type
harmonies
his
masterpiece
here
is
broken
arrow
a
unique
song
that
has
a
bit
of
everything
in
it
from
full
orchestration
with
a
bolero
type
of
drumbeat
mixed
with
a
countryrock
sound
with
numerous
rhythm
changes
this
song
rivals
anything
those
boys
from
liverpool
were
doing
at
the
time
there
may
not
have
been
a
better
songwriter
around
than
neil
young
during
the
springfield
period
leading
up
to
his
first
2
brilliant
albums
everybody
knows
this
is
nowhere
and
after
the
goldrush
although
this
is
a
relatively
small
retrospective
every
song
here
is
a
gem
buffalo
springfield
was
one
of
the
most
creative
bands
of
the
60's
but
because
of
their
strong
individual
writing
and
performing
talents
this
was
also
the
reason
for
their
breakup
this
is
an
excellent
historical
document
of
the
band
that
started
the
whole
folk
country
rock
movement
highly
recommended!

cd
now
that
we've
stopped
guffawing
over
the
limp
bizkit
remark
let's
get
serious
)
buffalo
springfield
was
a
great
midsixties
band
from
los
angeles
that
embodied
the
tendency
of
talented
rock
groups
to
provide
listeners
with
a
taste
of
greatness
only
to
end
up
splitting
apart
into
offspring
bands
that
in
most
cases
are
not
as
musically
satisfying
buffalo
springfield
included
some
of
the
truly
creative
artists
of
sixties
rock
steven
stills
neil
young
richie
furay
and
jim
messina
the
tension
between
their
distinctive
talents
and
styles
led
the
band
to
achieve
a
fresh
original
sound
that
today
over
thirty
years
later
is
still
incredible
to
hear
the
progeny
of
this
highly
original
group
which
included
poco
crosby
stills
and
nash
and
neil
young
with
crazy
horse
all
produced
great
recordings
in
their
time
but
i
still
wonder
longingly
what
buffalo
springfield
might
have
achieved
musically
had
the
band
been
able
to
stay
together
longer
fortunately
buffalo
springfield
did
leave
us
with
three
terrific
albums
which
provide
the
basis
for
this
best
of
collection
which
includes
twelve
selected
tracks
it's
likely
that
most
buffalo
springfield
fans
will
have
at
least
one
objection
to
the
track
selection
here
that's
nearly
always
the
case
with
best
of
albums
however
i
think
that
whoever
made
the
choices
did
about
as
well
as
anyone
could
do
any
album
that
includes
sixties
political
classic
for
what
it's
worth
hot
rockers
like
mr
soul
and
rock
and
roll
woman
gorgeous
pop
compositions
like
on
the
way
home
and
the
short
neil
young
composition
that
is
nearly
perfect
in
its
heartfelt
simplicity
i
am
a
child
has
got
to
be
considered
a
winner

the
reason
that

will
undoubtedly
hear
the
clash

only
did
they
produce
four
classic
sixties
albums(buffalo

they

bought
this
album
in
1967
the
harmonies
the
instrumentals
the
political
mood
at
the
time
and
the
lyrics
were
historical
moving
emotionally
somehow
at
