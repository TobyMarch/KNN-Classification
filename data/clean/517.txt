biography
jamie
o'neal
first
struck
music
city
gold
as
a
soughtafter
songwriter
it
was
only
later
that
her
own
singing
career
blossomed
o'neal
was
born
jamie
murphy
in
australia
to
professional
musician
parents
who
eventually
moved
to
las
vegas
and
a
casino
gig
via
hawaii
eventually
jamie
and
her
sister
samantha
began
to
perform
with
their
parents
this
led
to
a
vagabond
childhood
spent
traveling
across
america
in
an
rv
performing
at
state
fairs
conventions
and
as
an
opening
act
for
touring
country
stars
the
family
then
moved
to
nashville
where
it
recorded
three
selfreleased
albums
but
the
divorce
of
o'neal's
mom
and
dad
broke
up
the
band
and
she
moved
to
los
angeles
with
her
father
regular
high
school
wasn't
for
her
however
and
soon
o'neal
had
dropped
out
in
order
to
try
and
make
in
music
city
all
on
her
own
she
found
some
work
as
a
demo
performer
for
a
nashville
song
factory
but
soon
left
america
altogether
to
visit
her
mother
in
australia
there
she
began
performing
in
clubs
and
on
street
corners
and
landed
a
gig
as
a
backup
singer
for
pop
tart
kylie
minogue
but
o'neal
was
still
writing
her
own
songs
and
still
thought
that
nashville
might
be
her
ticket
a
demo
tape
sent
by
her
mother
to
old
contacts
in
nashville
generated
interest
and
in
1996
o'neal
was
offered
a
songwriting
contract
under
producer
harold
shedd
this
exposure
led
to
a
sweeter
songwriter/artistdevelopment
deal
with
emi
music
while
o'neal
sang
backup
for
established
country
acts
like
clay
davidson
and
ronnie
milsap
her
songs
were
covered
by
the
likes
of
leann
rimes
and
chely
wright
but
despite
this
success
o'neal
still
felt
stifled
as
she
still
wasn't
performing
her
own
material
that
changed
in
1998
when
an
audition
with
mercury
nashville's
keith
stegall
led
to
a
recording
contract
with
the
label
her
countrypop
debut
shiver
was
released
in
early
2000
it
was
nominated
for
three
grammy
awards
a
selftitled
effort
followed
almost
immediately
and
2003
saw
another
lp
after
taking
a
break
to
start
a
family
o'neal
returned
in
2005
