cd
this
is
probably
my
favorite
early
80's
so
called
new
wave
album
i
wouldn't
even
put
this
album
in
the
new
wave
or
any
other
category
because
i
believe
it
shows
a
truly
original
creativity
that
transcends
any
genre
this
record
creates
an
atmosphere
that
takes
the
listener
on
a
beautiful
trip
i
would
compare
it
to
a
walk
with
your
lover
on
a
wonderful
fall
day
in
an
english
garden
you
never
tire
of
the
feeling
it
gives
personal
favorites
include
someone's
calling
and
face
of
wood
but
all
the
songs
flow
together
as
if
being
played
in
a
suite
i
think
the
entire
album
shows
wonderful
attention
to
detail
in
both
lyrics
and
musicianship
in
an
era
where
a
band's
looks
in
it's
videos
were
the
most
important
element
modern
english
threw
that
concept
out
the
window
and
contributed
an
artisitc
statement
and
musical
feel
that
few
bands
from
that
era
could
capture
ever
notice
how
a
winter
snowfall
brings
beauty
to
everything
it
covers?
after
the
snow
will
add
beauty
and
wonder
to
your

cd
after
the
snow
is
truly
an
expression
of
eighties
music
at
its
nearbest
in
addition
to
the
euphoric
and
wellknown
i
melt
with
you
after
the
snow
contains
7
other
(mostly)
great
songs
as
well
as
5
bonus
tracks
what
we
find
here
is
rich
'80s
new
wave
rock
held
together
by
a
gentle
distinctly
folky
mellowness
(carry
me
down
even
features
a
trilling
flute
and
a
gentle
acoustic
guitar)
that's
just
british
enough
to
be
umistakeably
a
gem
of
an
era
gone
for
nearly
15
years
and
to
resemble
the
cure's
less
depressing
times
this
calm
sound
parallel
with
robbie
grey's
clear
deadpan
english
vocals
is
decorated
sparsely
with
thin
jerky
guitars
worthy
of
early
siouxsie
and
the
banshees
or
u2
the
two
contrasting
styles
compliment
each
other
quite
nicely
and
are
punctuated
occasionally
by
stephen
walker's
bubbly
robotic
keyboards
which
sound
as
if
they
remain
buried
in
the
mix
for
most
of
each
song
and
are
only
allowed
to
come
up
for
air
every
once
in
a
while
these
keyboards
can
sound
typically
and
humorously
'80s
but
overall
they
do
not
detract
from
the
soung
the
songs
conveniently
helped
along
by
their
folkiness
mostly
center
on
reflection
and
often
the
beauty
of
nature
but
at
times
can
escalate
into
tense
dark
cynicism
as
as
in
the
dark
reminsicience
of
after
the
snow
these
explosions
have
more
in
common
with
the
darker
'80s
goth
bands
unexpected
in
light
of
the
more
optimistic
tone
of
this
cd
but
not
totally
mysterious
since
after
the
snow
was
released
on
4ad
the
division
of
beggar's
banquet
which
has
been
home
to
such
goth
greats
as
bauhaus
love
and
rockets
the
birthday
party
gary
numan
and
the
cult
while
delineating
each
aspect
of
this
music
may
make
each
one
sound
clashing
or
egregious
they
blend
together
very
harmoniously
this
album
may
be
too
calm
or
bland
for
some
but
i
highly
recommend
it
to
fans
of
new
wave
or
other
'80s
styles
and
younger
fans
raised
on
more
recent
alternative
rock
may
find
something
relaxing
and
pleasant

cd
melt
with
you
is
synonymous
with
an
era
no
doubt
about
it
but
should
the
album
whence
it
sprang
be
relegated
to
oblivion?
i
think
not
while
melt
with
you
might
be
early80s
pop
of
the
moodiest
and
most
perversely
populist
sort
the
rest
of
the
album
is
imbued
with
a
personality
of
its
own
life
in
the
gladhouse
is
a
stomping
beast
that
gallops
along

its
own
beat
dawn
chorus
and
face

elements
that
linger
in
the
recesses
of

carry
me
down
is
almost
wistfully
medieval
in
its
execution
yet
not
in
a
pretentious
proggy
way
for
the
most
part
the
album's
production
aptly
presents
the
music
in
a
competent
manner
the
bonus
tracks
that
are
tacked
on
the
back
of
this
reissue
are
rather
cumbersome
since
most
are
demos
and
alternate
takes
the
choiciest
view
is
an
interesting
addition
since
it
somehow
degenerates
into
selfindulgent
feedback
shenanigans
of
the
most
vuesque
quality
overall
this
is
worth
checking
out
if
you're
a

of

this

there

than

one
of

is
so

so

look
a

paler
when
placed

i'll

seriously
got
to
be

of
the
best
songs

of
1980s
new

anthemic
wildly
structured
feelgood
and
evidently
made
for
driving
and
singing
along
what
a
song!
what
a
song
i'll
melt
with
you
is
a
song
that
simaltaneously
defines
and
transcends
the
1980sthe
wildness
of
an
effeminately
dressed
and
coifed
rebellion
the
happiness
of
smiling
hooligans
the
sort
of
time
when
everyone
(everyone
white
and
middle
class
and
american
anyway)
seemed
to
say
that's
cool
instead
of
that
sucks
i
lived
through
it
as
a
kid
and
i'm
still
living
through
it
through
my
older
brothers
and
through
music
such
as
this
i'll
melt
with
you
is
almost
enough
to
make
this
a
fivestar
album
and
maybe
it
is
enough
the
other
seven
songs
are
generally
catchy
as
well

a

duran
duranesque

a

they
haven't
aged
quite
as
well
as
most
of

songs
if
i
were
to
make
a
mix
tape
with
one
or
two
songs
for
every
decade
i'd
probably
have
i'll

with
you
represent
the
'80s
it
deserves
its
reputation
as
a
classic
and
this
album
after
the
snow
deserves
a
good
listen
