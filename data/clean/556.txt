bone
thugsnharmony
graced
with
a
quick
and
sometimes
sung
delivery
along
with
a
unique
sense
of
melody
bone
thugsnharmony
burst
out
of
cleveland
ohio
in
the
mid'90s
with
a
pair
of
massive
hits
(thuggish
ruggish
bone
and
tha
crossroads)
along
with
a
great
first
album
as
well
as
a
successful
followup
and
then
quickly
unraveled
mainstream
interest
dropped
off
toward
the
tail
end
of
the
'90s
but
the
group
which
underwent
a
series
of
lineup
changes
continued
to
release
new
material
via
mixtapes
and
albums
throughout
the
2000s
nwa's
eazye
signed
the
group

initially
comprised
of
krayzie
bone
wish
bone
fleshnbone
layzie
bone
and
bizzy
bone

to
ruthless
records
the
debut
release
from
bone
was
an
ep
creepin
on
ah
come
up
(1994)
the
ep
boasted
thuggish
ruggish
bone
a
conventional
gfunk
song
with
an
unconventional
array
of
bone
thug
rappers
that
became
an
overnight
summer
anthem
especially
throughout
the
midwest
the
single
crossed
into
the
billboard
hot
100
where
it
peaked
at
number
22
amid
the
fervor
the
group
immediately
reentered
the
studio
and
emerged
with
a
remarkable
album
e
1999
eternal
(1995)
the
album
topped
the
billboard
200
and
the
top
rb/hiphop
albums
charts
and
spawned
a
pair
of
popular
singles
1st
of
the
month
and
tha
crossroads
the
latter
a
dedication
to
the
deceased
eazye
and
a
grammy
award
recipient
as
was
in
vogue
at
the
time
the
group
members
subsequently
pursued
respective
solo
careers
and
also
a
mo
thugs
family
spinoff
group
none
of
these
ventures
rivaled
the
proper
bone
projects
at
this
point
the
onetime
cohesive
group
which
specialized
in
interwoven
harmonious
singing
as
well
as
rapping
became
conflicted
and
the
group
members
failed
to
collaborate
well
however
their
second
album
art
of
war
(1997)

an
ambitious
doubledisc
package

was
very
successful
not
only
did
it
top
the
same
billboard
charts
as
e
1999
eternal
but
lead
single
look
into
my
eyes
went
top
five
on
the
hot
100
within
a
year
of
release
it
was
certified
quadruple
platinum
for
over
four
million
units
sold
in
the
us
a
second
round
of
solo
albums
sold
poorly
and
bone
quickly
slid
off
the
mainstream
radar
occasional
reunions
such
as
2000's
btnhresurrection
and
2002's
thug
world
order
produced
some
moments
of
glory
but
these
were
few
and
far
between
thug
stories
released
in
2006
on
koch
placed
the
group

at
the
time
a
trio
minus
bizzy

in
the
top
30
of
the
billboard
200
bone
then
signed
to
swizz
beatz's
interscopeaffiliated
full
surface
boutique
label
where
they
issued
2007's
strength

loyalty
a
majorlabel
budget
allowed
for
guest
spots
from
the
game
mariah
carey
akon
bow
wow
and
twista
and
the
set
eventually
sold
over
500000
copies
earning
gold
certification
bizzy
returned
for
2010's
uni5
the
world's
enemy
the
album
debuted
at
number
14
on
the
billboard
200
a
handful
of
dates
excepted
bizzy
was
absent
from
the
album's
promotional
tour
he
returned
for
the
2013
release
art

wwiii
but
this
time
krayzie

were
out
of
