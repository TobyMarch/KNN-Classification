1)
the
french
band
air
is
a
duo
consisting
of
nicolas
godin
and
jeanbenoit
dunckel
they
went
to
school
in
versailles
(lyc&eacutee
jules
ferry)
before
forming
the
band
in
1995

their
critically
acclaimed
first
album
premiers
sympt&ocircmes
was
followed
by
the
release
of
moon
safari
the
virgin
suicides
(soundtrack)
10000hz
legend
and
talkie
walkie
in
2007
air
released
the
album
pocket
symphony
and
love
2
in
2009
the
seven
stars
songfacts
reports
that
air
was
commissioned
to
write
a
new
soundtrack
for
the
premiere
of
the
newly
restored
georges
m&eacuteli&egraves’
silent
film
le
voyage
dans
la
lune
at
the
2011
cannes
film
festival
despite
m&eacuteli&egraves’
film
only
having
a
runtime
of
14
minutes
air
still
produced
enough
music
to
fill
an
entire
album
which
will
be
released
as
their
seventh
lp
on
february
7
2012
although
air’s
music
is
often
referred
to
as
electronica
or
triphop
and
is
often
found
in
such
bins
in
record
stores
their
form
of
electronic
music
actually
owes
more
to
the
synthesizer
sounds
of
the
1970s
such
as
jean
michel
jarre
and
vangelis
other
influences
that
are
more
readily
apparent
than
house
and
techno
are
psychedelic
rock
pioneers
pink
floyd
and
krautrockers
tangerine
dream
(although
there
are
some
echoes
of
dance
music
styles
in
the
production)
another
influence
is
french
crooner
serge
gainsbourg
air’s
music
also
has
jazz
inflections
at
times
and
their
ability
to
improvise
is
more
clearly
highlighted
in
the
live
arena
