a
band
called

the
squires
guitarist
young
had
been
born
in

started
playing
in
bands
when

by
the
music
of
elvis
presley
after
breaking
up
the
squires
he
went
to
detroit

where
he
was
in
a
band
called
the
mynah
birds
a
group

around
singer
rick
james
(later
a
funksoul
superstar)
the
mynah
birds
also
included
another
canadian
bassist
bruce
palmer
young
and
palmer
soon
decided
to
relocate
to
los
angeles
where
they
had
little
success
until
young
happened
to
run
into
stills
the
two
decided
to
form
a
band
with
palmer
they
then
added
richie
furay
after
he
came
to
la
to
visit
stills
the
final
member
of
the
lineup
was
dewey
martin
another
canadian
who
had
spent
time
in
nashville
where
he
played
with
the
dillards
and
many
other
artists
a
mere
week’s
worth
of
rehearsals
preceded
their
first
gig
buffalo
springfield
which
initially
went
by
the
name
the
herd
quickly
gelled
into
a
unit
whose
tight
energetic
live
shows
at
the
whisky
a
gogo
where
they
held
down
a
magical
sixweek
residency
are
the
stuff
of
rock
and
roll
legend
the
group
which
took
its
name
from
a
steamroller
signed
with
atlantic
records
in
1966
buffalo
springfield’s
first
single
released
on
atlantic’s
atco
label
in
august
1966
was
the
neil
young
song
“nowadays
clancy
can’t
even
sing”
it
made
the
top
10
in
los
angeles
and
was
a
regional
hit
they
followed
that
in
december
with
the
stillspenned
“for
what
it’s
worth”&nbsp
“when
i
write
about
something
like
that”
stills
said
“i’m
separating
myself
from
the
whole
thing
i’m
an
observer
because
i’m
a
songwriter
and
i’m
here
to
spread
the
news
like
the
minstrels
of
the
15th
century
and
the
news
is
that
the
straight
world
has
been
getting
worse
and
worse
since
world
war
ii
those
boys
that
won
the
world
by
fire
were
great
but
now
they’re
trying
to
do
it
again
except
they’re
going
to
lose
this
time
because
the
fire’s
too
big”
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
later
in
1967
buffalo
springfield
had
some
more
regional
success
with
two
songs
written
by
stills
“bluebird”
and
“rock
‘n’
roll
woman”
the
group
boasted
an
almost
uncontainable
pool
of
talent
stills
young
and
furay
were
all
formidable
writers
guitarists
and
vocalists
however
they
were
also
very
strongwilled
individuals
when
bassist
palmer
got
deported
to
canada
following
a
drug
bust
producer
jim
messina
–
himself
a
singer
and
guitarist
with
a
predilection
for
country
and
folkflavored
rock
–
joined
the
band
internecine
squabbles
particularly
between
stills
and
young
led
to
buffalo
springfield’s
disbanding
but
not
before
they’d
recorded
three
classic
albums
that
sketched
a
number
of
directions
rock
would
follow
in
their
wake
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
the
careers
of
the
eagles
jackson
browne
and
others
without
buffalo
springfield
as
a
precursor
and
the
roots
of
the
popular
americana
movement
can
be
found
here
as
well
however
the
prolific
solo
careers
of
neil
young
stephen
stills
and
richie
furay
and
the
band
members’
respective
group
endeavors
–&nbspcrosby
stills
and
nash
(and
sometimes
young)
poco
and
loggins
and
messina
–
are
the
larger
ongoing
legacy
of
buffalo
springfield
neil
young
included
a
nostalgic
song
about
his
old
band
entitled
“buffalo
springfield
again”
on
his
2000
album
silver
and
gold
raising
speculation
that
some
sort
of
reunion
might
be
in
the
offing
however
the
deaths
of
palmer
in
2004
and
martin
in
2009
prevented
a
reunion
of
the
original
lineup
but
in
2010
young
stills
and
furay
got
back
together
to
play
the
annual
bridge
school
benefit
concert
in
california
the
following
year
the
three
musicians
–
joined
by
drummer
joe
vitale
and
bassist
rick
rosas
–
played
six
shows
in
oakland
california
followed
by
shows
in
los
angeles
and
santa
barbara
they
also
played
the
bonnaroo
music
and
arts
festival
in
tennessee
that
year
then
in
2012
furay
said
that
no
further
reunions
were
planned
