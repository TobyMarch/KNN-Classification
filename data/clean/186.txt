modest
mouse
were
one
of
the
most
surprising
commercial
success
stories
of
the
new
millennium

while
their
music
was
by
turns
taut
and
elliptical
and
the
lyrics
sometimes
cryptic
and
introspective
the
band
broke
through
to
the
mainstream
audience
with
the
platinumselling
good
news
for
people
who
love
bad
news
and
they
became
genuine
rock
stars
at
a
time
when
their
musical
peers
remained
cult
figures
modest
mouse
was
founded
in
1993
by
guitarist
and
vocalist
isaac
brock
bassist
eric
judy
and
drummer
jeremiah
green
brock
who
had
a
nomadic
childhood
was
only
18
and
living
in
a
shed
next
to
his
mother's
trailer
home
when
modest
mouse
began
working
together
with
the
shed
becoming
the
new
band's
rehearsal
space
and
base
of
operations
in
1994
modest
mouse
booked
time
at
calvin
johnson's
dub
narcotic
studio
in
olympia
washington
to
cut
their
first
record
and
johnson
released
their
debut
7
blue
cadet3
do
you
connect?
on
his
k
records
label
modest
mouse
soon
began
work
on
an
album
but
the
project
was
abandoned
and
the
material
went
unreleased
until
2001
when
it
appeared
on
a
collection
called
sad
sappy
sucker
after
releasing
a
handful
of
singles
modest
mouse
went
into
the
studio
with
johnson
as
producer
to
record
an
ep
the
fruit
that
ate
itself
but
by
the
time
it
was
released
the
group
had
already
moved
on
to
another
northwestbased
indie
label
up
records
1996's
this
is
a
long
drive
for
someone
with
nothing
to
think
about
produced
in
collaboration
with
steve
wold
(who
would
find
fame
a
few
years
later
as
grizzled
blues
hobo
seasick
steve)
was
modest
mouse's
first
proper
album
and
received
enthusiastic
reviews
in
the
independent
music
press
in
1997
modest
mouse
returned
with
the
lonesome
crowded
west
which
earned
more
positive
press
and
was
a
considerable
sales
success
by
indie
label
standards
supported
by
extensive
touring
as
modest
mouse's
following
grew
they
were
courted
by
majorlabel
scouts
and
they
eventually
signed
with
epic
records
who
released
the
moon

antarctica
in
2000
a
collection
of
demos
and
session
outtakes
everywhere
and
his
nasty
parlour
tricks
was
issued
in
2001
and
brock
released
an
album
with
his
side
project
ugly
casanova
in
2002
in
2003
it
was
announced
that
drummer
green

modest
mouse
benjamin
weikel

the
group's
new
percussionist
(he
also
doubled
on
keyboards)
and
dann
gallucci
who
had
been
a
guest
guitarist
on
the
sessions
for
sad
sappy
sucker
and
the
lonesome
crowded
west
became
an
official
member
of
the
band
the
new
lineup
recorded
2004's
good
news
for
people
who
love
bad
news
which
proved
to
be
modest
mouse's
commercial
breakthrough
rising
to
the
top
of
the
album
charts
spawning
the
hit
singles
float
on
and
ocean
breathes
salty
and
selling
over
a
million
copies
as
the
band
began
headlining
arenas
by
the
end
of
2004
green
returned
to
modest
mouse
and
in
2006
after
gallucci
left
the
group
the
band
recruited
johnny
marr

guitarist
with
the
smiths
to
take
his
place
for
the
recording
of
their
next
album
marr
not

the
ship
even
sank
he
became
a
full
member
of
modest
mouse
and
toured
with
the
group
in
support
of
the
album
which
debuted
at
number
one
on
the
billboard
album
charts
in
2005
brock
had
launched
his
own
record
label
glacial
pace
records
saying
the
name
reflected
his
own
slow
working
habits
while
modest
mouse
continued
to
play
live
shows
work
on
their
next
album
progressed
very
gradually
and
in
2009
they
issued
a
collection
of
outtakes
and
nonlp
single
sides
no
one's
first
and
you're
next
as
a
stopgap
a
tour
was
launched
in
support
but
as
marr
had
joined
the
cribs
jim
fairchild
(who
had
worked
with
grandaddy
and
all
smiles)
became
the
group's
new
guitarist
and
when
modest
mouse
played
a
round
of
shows
in
2012
the
group
debuted
a
new
lineup
with
the
addition
of
second
percussionist
joe
plummer
while
eric
judy
was
still
an
official
member
of
the
band
for
some
2012
dates
he
was
replaced
by
multiinstrumentalist
tom
peloso
who
had
been
touring
with
the
group
as
a
sideman
since
2004
