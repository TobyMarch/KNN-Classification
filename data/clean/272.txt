cd
like
any
greatest
hits
album
this
cd
suffers
from
a
mysterious
lack
of
some
of
seger's
best
work
where's
let
it
rock
for
example
or
beautiful
loser
fire
lake
nine
tonight
etc
i
know
there's
a
limited
amount
of
space
available
on
any
one
cd
for
such
a
prolific
artist
but
i'd
still
rather
have
seen
some
of
these
songs
than
what
ended
up
on
this
collection
that's
not
to
say
most
of
it
isn't
good
the
fire
inside
is
firmly
established
as
my
favorite
bob
seger
song
ever
a
driving
beat
a
catchy
melodic
line
and
the
typically
introspective
lyrics
that
are
the
reason
bob
seger
is
truly
a
rock
legend
a
string
of
classic
songs
occurs
with
hollywood
nights
still
the
same
and
mainstreet
but
while
the
use
of
roll
me
away
and
turn
the
page
near
the
beginning
isn't
bad
it
still
seems
like
there
are
better
songs
that
could
have
been
put
there
of
the
two
previously
unreleased
songs
c'est
la
vie
is
the
standout
even
though
it
was
originally
a
chuck
berry
number
seger
and
the
silver
bullet
band
do
a
wonderful
job
with
it
in
your
time
is
less
noteworthy
and
seems
to
be
there
mainly
to
underscore
the
fact
that
this
album
is
dedicated
to
the
children
of
the
band
members
a[]
overall
this
cd
doesn't
really
seem
representative
of
seger's
typical
style
to
me
but
it
still
contains
a
wealth
of
good
oldfashioned
rock
(since
it's
my
opinion
that
seger
never
wrote
a
bad
song)
and
it's
a
wise
investment

cd
over
the
past
2
decades
bob
seger
has
put
out
some
of
the
best
mainstream
rock
and
roll
and
this
release
gives
a
good
sample
of
that
most
greatest
hits
collections
tend
to
either
overlook
key
songs
when
dealing
with
successful
artists
or
give
you
a
bunch
of
filler
when
the
record
company
has
the
audacity
to
put
out
a
1
or
2
hit
wonder
greatest
hits
release
obviously
when
dealing
with
bob
seger
there
are
just
too
many
great
songs
but
these
release
overlooked
too
many
especially
when
there
were
over
20
minutes
left
blank
that
could
have
filled
with
rock
and
roll
never
forgets
katmandu
shame
on
the
moon
or
any
of
his
amazing
early
records
notwithstanding
what
is
here
is
good
and
there
is
absolutely
no
filler
this
1994
release
includes
a
new
song
that
is
really
good
as
well
as
a
very
cool
version
of
chuck
berry's
c'est
la
vie
capitol
records
is
attempting
to
correct
this
wrong
by
releasing
a
second
greatest
hits
volume
on
11/4/2003
the
good
news
that
that
this
release
will
include
overlooked
songs
as
well
as
newer
material
including
two
new
songs
but
back
to
thsi
release
the
songs
will
take
you
back
to
a
time
when
music
and
life
was
so
different
listening
great
songs
like
against
the
wind
night
moves
and
mainstreet
(which
i
am
lstening
to
right
now)
is
a
pleasure
that
i
had
not
enjoyed
in
a
long
time
as
i
am
now
revisiting
all
my
cds
as
i
had
gone
overboard
trying
to
buy
new
stuff
and
most
of
it
fails
to
impress
as
those
of
yesteryear
i
do
wish
that
capitol
records
had
released
a
remastered
version
of
this
release
as
it
did
with
many
others
in
the
bob
seger
catologue
as
there
are
some
incredible
songs
that
deserve
to
be
heard
more
clearly
i
hope
that
the
second
volume
is
remastered
but
it
does
not
seem
that
it
will
i'll
still
buy
it
and
i
will
have
most
of
the
must
have's
in
bob
seger's
great
career
he
really
needs
to
get
back
in
the
game
as
he's
been
in
the
sidelines
too
long
enjoy
this
release
but
just
make
sure
that
if
you
buy
it
you
know
that
some
of
your
favorites
are
not
included

cd
this
1994
compilation
from
capitol
is
really
a
misnomer
it
contains
only
9
of
segers
charted
singles
there's
a
lot
of
stuff
missing
that
capitol
cleverly
issued
on
greatest
hits
vol
2
but
it's
a
new
day
baby
most
major
record
companies
are
issuing
ultimate
collections
of
their
most
successful
and
prolific
artists
it
is
high
time
that
capitol
issued
just
such
a
disc
for
bob
seger
there
is
certainly
no
problem
with
the
music
on
greatest
hits
not
a
bad
track
in
the
bunch
several
of
bob's
biggest
hits
are
here
including
his
1976
classic
night
moves
still
the
same
and
against
the
wind
you'll
also
find
old
time
rock
and
roll
and
an
outstanding
remake
of
the
chuck
berry
tune
c'est
la
vie
but
one
cannot
help
but
come
away
feeling
cheated
by
this
collection
the
included
booklet
is
ok
but
nothing
special
and
contains
little
in
the
way
of
biographical
information
the
remastering
job
is
fine
but
again
at
this
stage
of
the
game
there
is
really
nothing
here
to
recommend
this
collection
i
suspect
that
capitol
will
correct
this
oversight
in
the
near
future
and
issue
a
more
impressive
20
track
overview
of
seger's
entire
career
in
the
meantime
i'll
simply
play
my
old
'45s!

i
agree
with
the
reviewer
from
michigan
who
rates
this
5
stars
for
the
songs
here
but
3
stars
for
the
songs
missing
clearly
you
can't
go
wrong
with
the
songs
from
this
alltime
american
rock
and
roll
legend
all
songs
are
legendary
and
wellknown
clearly
the
focus
is
on
the
slower
hits
and
songs
like
we've
got
tonight
and
against
the
wind
are
clearly
as
good
as
it
gets
obviously
staples
like
night
moves
and
old
time
rock

roll
are
classics
to
this
dayas
are
most
of
the
songs
here
turn
the
pagehello!
i
would
like
to
propose
a
second
greatest
hits
album
to
cover
so
many
of
bob's
legendary
hits
that
are
missing
here
for
starters
i
would
like
to
see
the
movie
songs
understanding
and
the
#
1
shakedown
included
as
they
aren't
anywhere
else
besides
their
respective
sound
tracks
as
for
other
album
songs
i'd
like
to
see
most
if
not
all
of
the
following
katmandu
(live
version)
travellin'
man
beautiful
loser
rock
and
roll
never
forgets
the
fire
down
below
feel
like
a
number
the
horizontal
bop
her
strut
fire
lake
let
it
rock
even
now
shame
on
the
moon
american
storm
and
maybe
even
the
real
love
and
lock
and
load
off
of
his
two
'90's
albums
of
all
new
material
does
anybody
else
think
this
would
be
a
great
idea?
clearly
this
man
is
a
legend
whose
music
is
among
the
most
real
and
heartfelt
i
have
ever
heard
if
you
are
a
fan
of
his
music
and
yet
don't
own
a
lot
of
his
albums
this
is
clearly
a
morethanrespectable
place
to
start
