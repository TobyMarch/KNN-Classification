steven
tyler
formed
his
own
band
called
the
strangeurs—later

reaction—
in
new
hampshire
meanwhile
perry
and
hamilton
formed
the
jam
band
(commonly
known
as
joe
perry's
jam
band)
which
was
based
on
freeform
and
blues
hamilton
and
perry
moved
to
boston
massachusetts
in
september[20]
there
they
met
joey
kramer
a
drummer
from
yonkers
new
york
kramer
knew
tyler
and
had
always
hoped
to
play
in
a
band
with
him[21]
kramer
a
berklee
college
of
music
student
decided
to
quit
school
to
join
jam
band[21]
in
1970
chain
reaction
and
jam
band
played
at
the
same
gig
tyler
immediately
loved
jam
band's
sound
and
wanted
to
combine
the
two
bands
in
october
1970
the
bands
met
up
again
and
considered
the
proposition
tyler
who
had
been
a
drummer
and
backup
singer
in
chain
reaction
adamantly
refused
to
play
drums
in
this
new
band
insisting
he
would
only
take
part
if
he
could
be
the
frontman
and
lead
vocalist[21]
the
others
agreed
and
a
new
band
was
born
the
band
moved
into
a
home
together
at
1325
commonwealth
avenue
in
boston
where
they
wrote
and
rehearsed
music
together
and
relaxed
in
between
shows[22]
the
members
of
the
band
reportedly
spent
afternoons
getting
stoned
and
watching
three
stooges
reruns[23]
one
day
they
had
a
poststooges
meeting
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
name
kramer
said
when
he
was
in
school
he
would
write
the
word
aerosmith
all
over
his
notebooks[23]
the
name
had
popped
into
his
head
after
listening
to
harry
nilsson's
album
aerial
ballet
which
featured
jacket
art
of
a
circus
performer
jumping
out
of
a
biplane
initially
kramer's
bandmates
were
nonplussed
they
all
thought
he
was
referring
to
the
sinclair
lewis
novel
they
were
required
to
read
in
high
school
english
class
no
not
arrowsmith
kramer
explained
aeroaerosmith[24]
the
band
settled
upon
this
name
after
also
considering
the
hookers
and
spike
jones[23][25]
soon
the
band
hired
ray
tabano
a
childhood
friend
of

steven

“
you

the
moment
all
five
of

got
together
in

for

while

it
was
plagued
with
several
incidents
mostly
attributed
to
drug
abuse
by
band
members[9]
their
problems
still
not
behind
them
the
group
was
signed
to
geffen
records
and
began
working
on
a
comeback[61]
despite
the
band
signing
on
to
a
new
record
company
the
band's
old
label
columbia
continued
to
reap
the
benefits
of
aerosmith's
comeback
releasing
the
live
companion

and

and
the
collection

in

the
band
released
the
album

their
first
studio
album
since
reuniting
while
the
album
did
receive
some
positive
reviews[63]
it
only
went
gold[35]
and
failed
to
produce
a
hit
single
or
generate
any
widespread
interest[46]
the
album's
most
notable
track
let
the
music
do
the
talking
was
in
fact
a
cover
of
a
song
originally
recorded
by
the
joe
perry
project
and
released
on
that
band's
album
of
the
same
name[64]
nevertheless
the
band
became
a
popular
concert
attraction
once
again
touring
in

track
blending
rock
and
roll
with

hop[25]
in
reaching
number
4
on
the
billboard
hot
100[66]
the
song
and
its
frequentlyaired
video
confirmed
rap's
mainstream
appeal
and
resurrected
aerosmith's
career
by
introducing
the
band's
music
to
a
new
generation[61]
yet
the
band
members'
drug
problems
still
stood
in
their
way
in
1986
tyler
completed
a
successful
drug
rehabilitation
program
after
an
intervention
by
his
fellow
band
members
a
doctor
and
manager
tim
collins
who
believed
that
the
band's
future
would
not
be
bright
if
tyler
did
not
get
treated
the
rest
of
the
band
members
also
completed
drug
rehab
programs
over
the
course
of
the
next
couple
of
years
according
to
the
band's
tellall
autobiography
collins
pledged
in
september
1986
he
could
make
aerosmith
the
biggest
band
in
the
world
by
1990
if
they
all
completed
drug
rehab[67]
their
next
album
was
crucial
because
of
the
commercial
disappointment
of
done
with
mirrors
and
as
the
band
members
became
clean
they
worked
hard
to
make
their
next
album
a
success[68]

(1987–1991)
[edit]
permanent

that
the
album
was
the
first
one
we
ever
did
sober[69]
part
of

commercial
success
involved
producer
bruce
fairbairn
whose
production
touches
(such
as
sound
effects
and

added
interest
to
the
album
and
the
use
of
outside
songwriters
such
as
desmond
child
jim
vallance
and
holly
knight
who
assisted
the
band
with
lyrics
while
the
group
was
initially
hesitant
to
using
outside
songwriters
including
tyler
being
furious
for
knight
getting
songwriting
credits
for
changing
one
word
(rag
time
became
rag
doll)
the
method
paid
off
as
permanent

became
the
band's
most
successful
album
in

the
group
went
on
a
subsequent
tour
with
labelmates
guns
n'
roses
(who
have
cited
aerosmith
as
a
major
influence)
which
was
intense
at
times

of

problems
on

and

went
on
around
the

time
as
these

tyler's
plans
to
become
a
talent
judge
on
american
idol
perry
criticized
tyler
for
not
consulting
the
rest
of
the

saying
that
he
found
out
on

internet
like
the

knew
anything
about

declared
he
understood
tyler's
reasons
and
wished
him
luck
but
stated
that
he
would
seek
different
projects
–
i'm
tired
of
waiting
around
so
i'm
not
passing
up
anything
right
now[174]
while
announcing
the
cocked
locked
and
ready
to
rock
tour
in
2009
tyler
and
perry
said
that
the
next
item
on
the
agenda
was
a
new
aerosmith
album
the
group's
first
since
2004's
honkin'
on
bobo
the
group
did
some
recording
with
producer
brendan
o'brien
in
2008
but
halted
because
of
tyler's
health
problems[175]
aerosmith
bassist
tom
hamilton
told

that
tyler
believes
he
has
the
time
and
energy
to
continue
fronting
the
band
while
also
being
a
judge
on
american
idol[176]
hamilton
explained
steven's
been
very
emphatic
in
saying
that
the
way
his
time
is
arranged
on
the
show
leaves
room
to
work
on
a
record
he's
been
taking
great
pains
to
remind
everybody
of
that
so
hopefully
that's
the
way
it
will
come
out[176]
on
