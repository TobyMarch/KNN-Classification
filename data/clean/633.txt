brooklyn
ny
united
states
(2001
–
present)
john
david
jackson
(born
november
18
1977
in
brooklyn
new
york)
better
known
by
his
stage
name
fabolous
is
a
grammy
award
nominated
american
rapper
actor
and
designer
signed
to
def
jam
records
he
released
his
debut
album
ghetto
fabolous
in
2001
and
has
since
released
2003’s
street
dreams
2004’s
real
talk
and
2007’s
from
nothin’
to
somethin’
all
of
which
have
collectively
sold
over
four
million
copies
in
the
united
states
his
fourth
studio
album
loso’s
way
was
released
in
july
of
2009
and
debuted
at
#1
on
the
billboard
200
chart
it
takes
talent
to
make
the
struggle
to
succeed
seem
effortless
but
that
is
the
gift
that
separates
artists
like
brooklyn’s
john
jackson
aka
fabolous
from
the
everyday
mc
while
most
rappers
spend
more
and
more
time
convincing
the
masses
of
their
“hustle”
fabolous
lets
his
work
speak
for
his
effort
with
two
platinum
albums
(2001’s
ghetto
fabolous
and
2003’s
street
dreams)
and
one
gold
(2004’s
real
talk)
to
his
credit
the
veteran
hitmaker
still
exudes
a
rookieofthe
year
swagger
after
recording
for
both
elektra
and
atlantic
records
fab
is
enjoying
a
home
coming
with
the
legendary
def
jam
label
his
first
recorded
song
was
“if
they
want
it”
from
dj
clue’s
the
professional
which
was
released
by
rocafella/def
jam
in
1998
“i
had
people
in
my
corner
already
over
there”
fab
says
of
dj
clue
and
ar
skane
the
desert
storm
duo
who
discovered
fabolous
“so
it
wasn’t
like
i
was
coming
to
a
new
neighborhood”
