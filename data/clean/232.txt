one
can't
help
but
wonder
what
the
other
members
of
both
jane's
addiction
and
porno
for
pyros
think
of
their
erstwhile
lead
vocalist
repackaging
their
hits
into
a
collection
bearing
only
his
name
in
that
respect
the
whole
thing
is
a
bit
curious
but
once
you
get
past
the
presentation
and
into
the
music
it
really
becomes
irrelevant
particularly
since
the
16song
collection
kicks
off
with
two
new
tunesthe
electronicameetsrock
jam
of
the
title
track
and
farrell's
drum

bass
workout
of
the
led
zeppelin
chestnut
whole
lotta
lovethat
clearly
show
it
is
indeed
farrell's
genius
that
drove
both
his
previous
bands
the
rest
of
the
material
rather
than
just
being
a
straight
hits
compilation
features
some
rarities
and
remixes
(been
caught
stealing
lou
reed's
satellite
of
love)
alongside
fm
staples
such
as
jane
says
stop
and
pets
rev
is
a
complete
musical
package
that
freely
ranges
from
dance
music
to
hard
rock
to
funk
to
psychedelia
all
bearing
the
unmistakable
stamp

farrell's
soaring

cd
wow
i'm
shocked
at
all
of
the
negative
feelings
about
this
album
mostly
because
this
album
is
exactly
what
it
appears
to
be

a
greatest
hits
album
people
who
purchased
this
album
thinking
it
was
an
album
of
new
material
apparently
didn't
even
bother
to
look
over
the
track
listing
first
so
suddenly
it's
perry's
fault?
come
on
just
because
it
doesn't
meet
some
fans
high
expectations
doesn't
mean
the
music
isn't
good
here
is
what
rev
offers
newcomers
will
get
a
nice
overview
of
perry's
work
with
his
two
seminal
bands
the
great
jane's
addiction
and
the
underrated
porno
for
pyros
longtime
fans
shouldn't
be
too
upset
with
the
old
material
(you
liked
it
once
didn't
you?)
plus
you
get
two
new
songs
(the
title
track
featuring
tom
morello
from
rage
against
the
machine
and
john
frusciante
from
the
chili
peppers
and
a
neatly
bizarre
cover
of
zeppelin's
whole
lotta
love)
a
different
mix
of
been
caught
stealing
(that
you
may
or
may
not
have)
and
their
contributions
to
a
grateful
dead
tribute
album
(ripple)
and
the
soundtracks
to
the
cable
guy
and
private
parts
(satellite
of
love
and
hard
charger
respectively)
all
in
all
a
pretty
nice
compact
collection
i
myself
put
off
buying
this
album
for
a
long
long
time
knowing
full
well
it
was
simply
greatest
hits
collection
finally
my
brother
was
nice
enough
to
get
it
for
me
for
christmas
and
i'm
not
disappointed
with
it
whatsoever
buy
it
be
happy
and
we'll
see
you
down
the

cd
if
you
are
a
janes/pyros
fan
you'll
know
all
of
the
tracks
except
for
the
first
two
they're
both
'interesting'
tunes
(
a
drum

bass
version
of
led
zep's
whole
lotta
love)
but
maybe
for
diehard
fan
types
only
supposedly
perry
had
to
release
this
album
for
contractual
purposes
as
he
is
switching
record
labels
tentative
plans
for
releasing
a
cd
of
all
new
material
spring
2000bottom
line
with
rev
i
give
it
4
stars
because
it
contains
great
music
from
two
great
bands
but
it's
a
cd
to
get
mainly
if
you're
not
fimiliar
with
janes/pyros
and
want
to
capture

although
rev
and
whole
lotta
love
are
interesting
gems
i
was
a
little
disappointed
when
i
played
this
and
realised
that
this
is
more
of
a
best
of
janes/pornos
the
first
two
tracks
are
the
only
previously
unreleased
material
the
last
few
tunes
were
previously
available
only
on
soundtracks
or
compilations
and
are
nice
additions
since
most
folks
probably
don't
have
cable
guy
soundtrack
etc
even
though
i
knew
that
this
release
was
just
a
contractual
obligation
by
perry
before
he
moves
on
and
even
though
anything
that
perry
does
is
wonderful
and
genius



i
just
didn't
realize
that
i'd
be
getting
the
exact
same
tracks
as
they
appear
on
nothing's
shocking
ritual
de
lo
habitual
porno
for

once
i
got
over
the
realization
this
wasn't
new
material
i
thoughtcool
i
mean
at
the
time
this
came
out
who
knew
he
would
still
release
song
yet
to
be
sung
get
back
together
with
jane's
addiction
and
relaunch
lollapalooza?
i
should
have
known
as
odd
as
it
seemed
to
put
the
best
of
his
two
bands
on
one
disc
it's
actually
not
considering
that
they
are
fairly
similar
what's
stranger
is
that
there
isn't
just
a
best
of
jane's
addiction
of
course
maybe
that's
what
kettle
whistle
was
supposed
to
be
anyway
regardless
of
what
it's
not
it
is
roughly
the
best
of
jane's
addiction
porno
for
pyro's
and
a
few
extra's
and
when
you
get
stop
pets
and
ripple
on
the
same
cd
can't

cd
being
a
jane's
addiction
and
perry
farrell
fan
for
a
long
time
i
finally
decided
to
check
this
one
out
i
don't
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
do
so
it
is
an
absolutely
great
album
it
includes
a
wide
selection
of
jane's
porno
and
perry
songs
even
a
couple
of
new
ones
i
hadn't
heard
i
don't
think
there
is
one
song
on
here
that
isn't
good
highly
recommend
it!!!

cd
having
actually
read
the
song
listing
on
the
back
of
the
cd
before
buying
i
fully
expected
a
greatest
hits
package
and
i
wasn't
disappointed
a
great
collection
of
hits
from
jane's
addition
and
porno
for
pyros
the
new
songs
are
great
too
especially
the
strange
take
on
whole
lotta
love
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
yet
to
listen
to
janes
addiction
or
porno
for
pyros
a
great
introduction
to
either
band

cd
i've
never
seen
this
cd
until
now
total
of
sixteen
tracks
starts
off
with
two
perry
farrell
songs

the
title
cut
rev
and
his
okay
cover
of
led
zeppelin's
whole
lotta
love
then
you
get
six
jane's
addiction
tunes
including
a
12
remix
edit
of
been
caught
stealing
followed
by
eight
porno
for
pyros
songs
that
sort
of
is
(now)
luring
me
to
pull
out
my
two
porno
for
pyros
cd's
for
a
spin
i
can't
honestly
remember
the
last
time
i
heard
some
of
these
gems
like
the
memorable
kimberly
austin
tahitian
moon
and
pets
i
believe
that
'rev'
can
serve
several
purposes

for
maybe
a
new
fan
(if
any
actually
exist)
as
sort
of
like
a
greatest

package
or
even
a
musthave
