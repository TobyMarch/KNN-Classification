his

are
so
great
and
he
consistently
chooses
some
of
the

i
love
country
in
all
its
forms
used
to
be
a
snob
about
the
pop
sound
but
now
just
think
of
country
as
an
umbrella
with
its
different
sects
i
adore
db
over
most
of
the
guys
even
tho
i
like
the
chesneys
and
urbans
of
the
world
his
trad
stuff
is
what
makes
me
love
him
have
most
of
his
cd's
in
my
mp3
and
never
tire
of
'em
for
me
it's
him
dwight
and
vince
gill
ridge
is
my
fave
love
when
he
sings
w/
a
kraus
don't
mind
the
pandering'
b/c
it
allows
him
to
cut
loose
be
a
good
ol'
boy
and
make
him
more
appreciative
of
the
bluegrass
he
gets
it
and
i
need

agree
with

although
i
believe
his
more
modern
mainstream
country
tracks
are
miles
ahead
of
his
competition
he
needs

more
bluegrass
i
can't
