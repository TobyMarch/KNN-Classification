bon
jovi
have
consistently
been
one
of
the
most
successful
recordselling
and
arenafilling
rock
acts
of
their
generation
starting
with
their
roots
in
the
glam
and
pop
metal
scene
of
the
early’80s
the
band
have
kept
on
cranking
out
hits
and
selling
out
shows
long
after
most
bands
of
that
genre
have
long
since
faded
due
in
part
to
the
strength
and
diversity
of
their
songwriting
it
helped
that&nbsp&nbspthe
jersey
rocker’s
face
launched
a
thousand
teen
magazine
covers
back
in
the
day
and
the
fact
that
jon
bon
jovi
is
one
of
rock’s
savviest
selfmarketers
—
with
a
great
voice
and
a
way
with
a
song
hook
—
hasn’t
hurt
the
group
either
while
the
group’s
later
work
has
veered
away
from
their
traditional
sound
to
explore
pop
adult
contemporary&nbsp
and
even
country
music

'born
to
be
my
baby'
from
'new
jersey'
(1988)
&nbsp
&nbsp
one
of
the
main
things
that
separated
bon
jovi
from
other
'80s
popmetal
bands
were
their
working
class
anthems
'born
to
be
my
baby'
was
certainly
one
of
the
best
with
its
simple
message
of
undying
love
making
life
worth
living
among
the
stress
of
juggling
jobs
bills
and
life
in
general
the
strong
hook
and
alluring
arrangement
of
'born
to
be
my
baby'
make
the
track
one
of
the

'wild
in
the
streets'
from
'slippery
when
wet'
(1986)
&nbsp
&nbsp
bon
jovi
broke
through
to
superstardom
with
'slippery
when
wet'
which
featured
three
of
their
biggest
hits
but
'wild
in
the
streets'
is
somewhat
of
a
lost
classic
from
that
period
with
its
tale
of
youthful
shenanigans
that
draws
from
the
musicians'
upbringing
in
new
jersey

like
much
of
the
band's
best
work
the
track
features
a
balance
of
keyboards
and
guitars
in
the
main
riff
that
heralds
a
subtle
shift
to
pop
while
richie
sambora's
guitar
solo
borrows
from
chuck
berry
hear
'wild
in
the
streets'
&nbsp
&nbsp
8
'i'll
be
there
for
you'
from
'new
jersey'
(1988)
&nbsp
&nbsp
by
the
time
bon
jovi
achieved
their
commercial
peak
it
was
practically
a
contractual
obligation
for
rock
bands
to
include
at
least
one
big
power
ballad
on
each
album
bon
jovi
proved
very
effective
with
ballads
but
none
moreso
than
'i'll
be
there
for
you'
which
became
the
group's
fourth
no
1
single
the
track
also
pointed
the
way
toward
the
kind
of
softer
sound
that
would
dominate
subsequent
albums
hear
'i'll
be
there
for
you'
&nbsp
&nbsp
7
'in
and
out
of
love'
from
'7800
fahrenheit'
(1985)
&nbsp
&nbsp
bon
jovi
were
on
the
cusp
of
rock
stardom
when
they
released
'7800
fahrenheit'
the
track
'in
and
out
of
love'
is
an
amalgam
of
some
of
their
influences
with
a
guitar
riff
that
hints
at
kiss
and
a
keyboard
part
reminiscent
of
aldo
nova
the
song
is
like
a
class
in
pop
metal
101
with
its
screamingtobeheard
vocal
stacks
and
flashy
guitar
solo

not
to
mention
the
posing
and
hairstyles
in
the
accompanying
video
hear
'in
and
out
of
love'
&nbsp

'lay
your
hands
on
me'
from
'new
jersey'
(1988)
&nbsp
&nbsp
'lay
your
hands
on
me'
saw
bon
jovi
expanding
their
musical
approach
a
bit
with
a
long
drumandkeyboardbased
intro
before
the
track
launches
into
the
main
guitar
riff
the
fistpumping
chant
of
hey!
is
a
concert
staple
the
song
was
written
around
sambora's
guitar
riff
while
the
group
were
in
the
studio
recording
released
as
the
fourth
single
from
'new
jersey'
the
song
went
to
no
7
in
the
billboard
charts
hear
'lay
your
hands
on
me'
&nbsp

'you
give
love
a
bad
name'
from
'slippery
when
wet'
(1986)
&nbsp
&nbsp
bon
jovi
were
teetering
on
the
brink
of
mainstream
stardom
when
'you
give
love
a
bad
name'
gave
them
the
push
they
needed
to
become
household
names
written
with
outside
writer
desmond
child
the
song
starts
out
with
the
nowiconic
a
capella
chorus
shot
through
the
heart
and
you're
to
blame
/
you
give
love
a
bad
name
the
track
centers
around
a
heavy
rock
riff
but
definitely
slants
toward
a
pop
arrangement
which
helped
to
give
bon
jovi
their
first
no
1
hit
and
certainly
qualifies
as
one
of
the
the
top
10
bon
jovi
songs
hear
'you

love

name'

'bad
medicine'
from
'new
jersey'
(1988)
&nbsp
&nbsp
if
'slippery
when
wet'
made
bon
jovi
into
superstars
then
'new
jersey'
made
them
into
rock
icons
'bad
medicine'
was
the
lead
single
from
the
album
and
it
helped
bridge
the
gap
between
the
band's
hard
rock
past
and
more
melodic
future
with
its
strong
pop
chorus
set
to
an
insistent
rock
groove
heavy
enough
to
satisfy
the
group's
rock
fans
and
pop
enough
to
win
mainstream
fans
the
track
landed
at
no
1
in
the
billboard
charts
hear
'bad
medicine'
&nbsp
&nbsp
3
'runaway'
from
'bon
jovi'
(1984)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
first
bon
jovi
album
was
one
of
the
heralds
of
a
coming
changing
of
the
musical
guard
incorporating
many
of
the
hard
rock
elements
of
their
'70s
influences
with
a
new
emphasis
on
pop
hooks
and
visual
appeal
'runaway'
was
a
perfect
alloy
of
hard
rock
and
pop
melody
highlighted
by
a
strong
vocal
performance
from
jon
bon
jovi
that
contained
the
nowiconic
falsetto
part
at
the
end
the
track
actually
hails
from
a
batch
of
demos
that
featured
a
different
group
of
players

most
notably
rick
springfield
guitarist
tim
pierce
whose
inimitable
style
is
unmistakable

'runaway'

or
alive'
from
'slippery
when
wet'
(1986)
&nbsp
&nbsp
few
songs
of
the
last
30
years
are
more
iconic
than
'wanted
dead
or
alive'
though
it's
not
one
of
bon
jovi's
no
1
hits
its
long
shelf
life
at
classic
rock
radio
has
ensured
it
a
prime
placement
in
the
top
10
bon
jovi
songs
the
track
began
jon
bon
jovi's
lyrical
love
affair
with
cowboy
imagery
drawing
an
analogy
between
the
life
of
an
old
west
outlaw
and
a
touring
rock
musician
sambora's
acoustic
riff
guitar
solo
and
backing
vocal
are
essential
elements
of
the
track
hear
'wanted
dead
