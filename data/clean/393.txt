biography
jefferson
starship
was
among
the
most
successful
arena
rock
bands
of
the
1970s
and
early
'80s
an
even
greater
commercial
entity
than
its
predecessor
jefferson
airplane
the
band
out
of
which
it
evolved
many
jefferson
airplane
fans
decried
the
group's
new
more
mainstream
musical
direction
especially
after
airplane
singers
grace
slick
and
marty
balin
departed
in
1978
but
with
shifting
personnel
jefferson
starship
managed
to
please
its
new
fans
and
some
old
ones
over
a
period
of
a
decade
before
it
shifted
gears
into
even
more
overtly
pop
territory
and
changed
names
again
to
become
simply
starship
jefferson
airplane
the
seminal
san
francisco
psychedelic
rock
band
of
the
1960s
noted
for
its
hits
somebody
to
love
and
white
rabbit
began
to
fragment
in
the
early
'70s
lead
guitarist
jorma
kaukonen
and
bassist
jack
casady
increasingly
were
preoccupied
with
their
spinoff
group
hot
tuna
while
the
band's
other
creative
axis
rhythm
guitarist/singer
paul
kantner
(born
paul
lorin
kantner
in
san
francisco
ca
march
17
1941)
and
singer
grace
slick
(born
grace
barnett
wing
in
or
near
chicago
il
october
30
1939)
having
become
a
romantic
couple
had
their
own
musical
and
political
interests
and
singer
marty
balin
(born
martyn
jerel
buchwald
in
cincinnati
oh
january
30
1942)
the
odd
man
out
had
become
sufficiently
disenchanted
with
the
band
he
himself
had
formed
that
he
quit
jefferson
airplane
at
the
end
of
a
tour
over
the
thanksgiving
weekend
in
1970
the
following
week
saw
the
release
of
blows
against
the
empire
kantner's
debut
solo
album
which
he
had
recorded
with
a
long
list
of
musician
friends
from
jefferson
airplane
the
grateful
dead
and
crosby
stills

nash
among
others
to
pay
tribute
to
this
looseknit
studio
ensemble
and
refer
to
the
album's
science
fiction
theme
kantner
cobilled
the
album
to
jefferson
starship
even
though
there
was
as
yet
no
such
permanent
entity
nevertheless
the
album
featured
performers
who
would
be
members
of
jefferson
starship
when
it
was
established
as
a
real
band
in
particular
kantner
slick
and
quicksilver
messenger
service
member
david
freiberg
(born
in
boston
ma
august
24
1938)
a
year
later
in
late
1971
kantner
and
slick
released
a
duo
album
sunfighter
one
track
earth
mother
was
a
song
written
by
jack
traylor
a
highschool
english
teacher
and
friend
of
kantner's
and
on
lead
guitar
was
teenager
craig
chaquico
(born
september
26
1954)
a
student
of
traylor's
and
a
member
of
his
band
steelwind
jefferson
airplane
gave
what
turned
out
to
be
its
final
performance
in
september
1972
by
which
time
freiberg
had
joined
the
group
the
next
album
out
of
the
jefferson
airplane
troupe
was
baron
von
tollbooth

the
chrome
nun
credited
to
kantner
slick
and
freiberg
and
released
in
the
spring
of
1973
an
album
that
featured
the
other
members
of
jefferson
airplane
in
subsidiary
roles
and
on
which
chaquico
also
appeared
many
of
the
same
musicians
appeared
on
grace
slick's
debut
solo
album
manhole
released
in
early
1974
when
it
became
apparent
that
kaukonen
and
casady
were
not
interested
in
reconvening
jefferson
airplane
kantner
decided
to
form
a
permanent
touring
band
without
them
the
name
jefferson
airplane
was
coowned
by
casady
kantner
kaukonen
slick
and
the
band's
manager
bill
thompson
so
kantner
determined
to
call
the
revised
unit
jefferson
starship
the
new
band
began
with
the
remaining
elements
of
the
old
one
kantner
on
rhythm
guitar
and
vocals
slick
on
vocals
freiberg
on
vocals
and
keyboards
papa
john
creach
(born
john
henry
creach
in
beaver
falls
pa
may
18
1917
died
february
22
1994)
on
electric
violin
and
john
barbata
(born
in
passaic
nj
april
1
1945)
on
drums
chaquico
still
a
teenager
but
at
least
out
of
high
school
was
the
logical
choice
for
lead
guitarist
jorma
kaukonen's
brother
peter
(who
had
appeared
on
blows
against
the
empire
sunfighter
and
manhole)
was
brought
in
on
bass
the
band
began
rehearsals
in
january
1974
and
opened
its
first
tour
in
chicago
on
march
19
the
tour
ran
through
april
after
which
the
band
prepared
to
go
into
the
studio
peter
kaukonen
did
not
work
out
however
and
he
was
replaced
in
june
by
british
veteran
pete
sears
(born
may
27
1948)
who
had
worked
on
manhole
during
the
recording
sessions
in
july
kantner
reunited
with
marty
balin
to
write
the
power
ballad
caroline
which
balin
agreed
to
sing
on
the
album
kantner
and
slick
hedged
their
bets
by
putting
their
names
on
either
side
of
the
name
jefferson
starship
on
the
cover
of
the
album
dragon
fly
when
it
was
released
in
october
1974
they
needn't
have
worried
even
though
the
single
ride
the
tiger
petered
out
at
number
84
dragon
fly
just
missed
the
top
ten
and
went
gold
within
six
months
selling
as
well
as
jefferson
airplane
albums
generally
did
balin
joined
the
band
onstage
at
its
performance
at
the
winterland
ballroom
in
san
francisco
on
november
24
(four
years
after
his
final
jefferson
airplane
appearance)
and
then
agreed
to
join
jefferson
starship
as
a
permanent
member
with
balin
aboard
the
eightmember
jefferson
starship
went
back
into
the
studio
in
february
1975
to
record
its
second
album
and
came
out
in
june
with
red
octopus
which
turned
out
to
be
the
bestselling
album
of
the
entire
jefferson
airplane/jefferson
starship/starship
career
largely
due
to
the
presence
of
balin's
ballad
miracles
which
became
a
top
ten
hit
(slick
and
sears'
play
on
love
was
also
a
singles
chart
entry)
the
album
first
hit
number
one
(which
no
jefferson
airplane
album
had
ever
done)
in
september
and
bounced
in
and
out
of
the
top
spot
for
the
next
two
months
eventually
it
sold
over
two
million
copies
(at
this
point
creach
quietly
exited
the
band)
red
octopus
set
a
pattern
for
the
next
two
jefferson
starship
albums
balin
whose
love
songs
had
dominated
the
early
days
of
jefferson
airplane
but
who
had
been
shunted
aside
by
the
more
political
and
abstract
interests
of
other
bandmembers
returned
to
a
major
role
thanks
to
the
commercial
success
of
miracles
unlike
jefferson
airplane
which
valued
the
individual
expression
of
its
members
however
bizarre
jefferson
starship
was
interested
in
making
commercial
music
even
if
it
was
written
by
people
outside
the
band
spitfire
released
in
june
1976
was
another
millionseller
boasting
the
balinsung
top
20
hit
with
your
love
earth
released
in
february
1978
also
went
platinum
spurred
by
the
top
ten
hit
count
on
me
and
its
top
20
followup
runaway
the
commercial
success
masked
increasing
personnel
problems
however
and
those
problems
came
out
during
the
band's
european
tour
in
june
1978
when
slick
suffering
from
some
combination
of
illness
and
substance
abuse
problems
missed
shows
and
gave
substandard
performances
she
left
the
tour
early
and
at
its
conclusion
balin
also
quit
the
band
after
the
remaining
members
returned
home
to
regroup
barbata
was
involved
in
a
serious
automobile
accident
that
forced
him
to
drop
out
this
left
remaining
members
kantner
freiberg
chaquico
and
sears
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next
in
january
1979
they
brought
in
veteran
rock
drummer
aynsley
dunbar
(born
in
liverpool
england
january
10
1946)
to
replace
barbata
in
april
mickey
thomas
(born
in
cairo
ga
december
3
1949)
who
possessed
the
soaring
tenor
voice
behind
the
elvin
bishop
group's
1976
hit
fooled
around
and
fell
in
love
was
drafted
in
to
replace
both
slick
and
balin
this
revamped
sextet
went
into
the
studio
in
june
1979
and
in
october
the
pointedly
titled
fifth
jefferson
starship
album
freedom
at
point
zero
was
released
critics
carped
that
with
balin
and
slick
gone
and
thomas
installed
the
band's
sound
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
arena
rock
stalwarts
like
boston
foreigner
and
journey
but
of
course
those
bands
were
selling
in
the
millions
whatever
the
critics
thought
and
chaquico
even
took
the
comparisons
as
a
compliment
the
album
spawned
a
top
20
hit
in
jane
and
while
it
did
not
match
the
success
of
its
predecessors
it
reached
the
top
ten
and
went
gold
validating
the
new
version
of
the
band
at
least
in
commercial
terms
kantner
addressed
the
criticisms
on
the
next
jefferson
starship
album
modern
times
released
in
the
spring
of
1981
in
a
song
called
stairway
to
cleveland
(we
do
what
we
want)
the
album
a
goldselling
top
40
hit
featuring
a
top
40
single
in
find
your
way
back
was
also
notable
for
background
vocals
by
grace
slick
(and
a
duet
with
thomas
on
stranger)
slick
having
overcome
her
personal
problems
had
launched
a
fullfledged
solo
career
issuing
albums
in
1980
and
early
1981
but
when
jefferson
starship
toured
in
the
summer
she
went
along
and
soon
was
back
as
a
fullfledged
bandmember
in
september
1982
aynsley
dunbar
left
jefferson
starship
and
was
replaced
by
donny
baldwin
another
former
member
of
the
elvin
bishop
group
the
band's
next
album
winds
of
change
was
released
the
following
month
it
sported
two
top
40
hits
be
my
lady
and
the
title
song
and
it
eventually
reached
goldrecord
status
nuclear
furniture
released
in
may
1984
enjoyed
comparable
success
spawning
the
top
40
hit
no
way
out
by
this
point
however
kantner
was
no
longer
willing
to
defend
the
band's
arena
rock
tendencies
feeling
that
he
had
lost
control
of
the
group
he
determined
to
leave
it
playing
his
last
show
on
june
23
before
quitting
he
also
felt
however
that
the
band
should
dissolve
without
him
and
when
the
other
members
disagreed
he
sued
over
money
and
the
rights
to
the
name
jefferson
starship
in
october
1984
kantner's
suit
was
settled
in
march
1985
with
a
cash
payment
and
the
compromise
that
jefferson
starship
a
name
to
be
owned
51
percent
by
slick
and
49
percent
by
manager
bill
thompson
would
be
retired
in
favor
of
starship
the
name
by
which
the
band
would
continue
to
work
starship
went
on
to
considerable
commercial
success
in
the
second
half
of
the
1980s
before
splitting
up
in
the
early
'90s
kantner
went
on
to
form
the
kbc
band
featuring
marty
balin
and
jack
casady
which
made
one
selftitled
album
in
1986
and
then
to
participate
in
a
oneoff
reunion
of
jefferson
airplane
in
1989
in
1992
he
organized
a
new
band
with
which
he
toured
under
the
name
jefferson
starship
(he
sometimes
billed
it
as
jefferson
starship
—
the
next
generation)
he
did
not
have
the
legal
right
to
do
this
but
neither
slick
nor
thompson
took
action
to
stop
him
in
fact
slick
though
she
had
declared
herself
retired
after
the
jefferson

made
occasional
