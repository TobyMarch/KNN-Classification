[edit]
in
the
late
1960s
roy
wood
—
guitarist
vocalist
and
songwriter
of
the
move
—
had
an
idea
to
form
a
new
band
that
would
use
violins
cellos
string
basses
horns
and
woodwinds
to
give
their
music
a
classical
sound
taking
rock
music
in
the
direction
that
the
beatles
had
left
off[citation

jeff
lynne
frontman
of
fellow
birmingham
group
the
idle
race
was
excited
by
the
concept
in
january
1970
when
carl
wayne
left
the
move
lynne
accepted
wood's
second
invitation
to
join
the
band
on
the
condition
that
they
focus
their
energy
on
the
new
project
on
12
july
1970
when
wood
added
multiple
cellos
to
a
lynnepenned
song
intended
to
be
a
move
bside
the
new
concept
became
a
reality
and
10538

lengthy

in
1971
(it
was
released
in
the
united

as
no

chosen
because
a
record
company
secretary
had
tried
to
ring
the

get
the
name
of
the

–
since
they

[edit]
1976
logo
earlier
logo
the
group's
name
is
an
intended
pun
based
not
only
on
electric
light
(as
in
a
light
bulb
as
seen
on
early
album
covers)
but
also
using
electric
rock
instruments
combined
with
a
light
orchestra
(orchestras
with
only
a
few
cellos
and
violins
that
were
popular
in
britain
during
the
1960s)
the
official
band
logo
designed
in
1976
by
artist
kosh
was
first
seen
on
their
1976
album
a
new
world
record
and
is
based
on
a
1946
wurlitzer
jukebox
model
4008
speaker
the
4008
speaker
was
itself
based
upon
the
upper
cabinet
of
the
wurlitzer
model
1015
jukebox[24]
the
band's
previous
logo
designed
by
john
kehe
at
united
artists
records
took
its
cues
from
the
general
electric
logo
the
new
logo
appeared
on
most
of
the
band's
subsequent
album
covers
in
various
forms
for
instance
on
1977's
out
of
the
blue
the
logo
was
turned
into
a
huge
flying
saucer
space
station
an
enduring
image
now
synonymous
with
the
band
on
the
followup
album

the
logo
became
a

glowing
