more
than
any
other
rapper
dr
dre
was
responsible
for
moving
away
from
the
avantnoise
and
political
stance
of
public
enemy
and
boogie
down
productions
as
well
as
the
party
vibes
of
oldschool
rap
instead
dre
pioneered
gangsta
rap
and
his
own
variation
of
the
sound
gfunk
bdp's
early
albums
were
hardcore
but
cautionary
tales
of
the
criminal
mind
but
dre's
records
with
nwa
celebrated
the
hedonistic
amoralistic
side
of
gang
life
dre
was
never
much
of
a
rapper

his
rhymes
were
simple
and
his
delivery
was
slow
and
clumsy

but
as
a
producer
he
was
extraordinary
with
nwa
he
melded
the
noise
collages
of
the
bomb
squad
with
funky
rhythms
on
his
own
he
reworked
george
clinton's
elastic
funk
into
the
selfstyled
gfunk
a
slowrolling
variation
that
relied
more
on
sound
than
content
when
he
left
nwa
in
1992
he
founded
death
row
records
with
suge
knight
and
the
label
quickly
became
the
dominant
force
in
mid'90s
hiphop
thanks
to
his
debut
the
chronic
soon
most
rap
records
imitated
its
sound
and
his
productions
for
snoop
doggy
dogg
and
blackstreet
were
massive
hits
for
nearly
four
years
gfunk
dominated
hiphop
and
dre
had
enough
sense
to
abandon
it
and
death
row
just
before
the
whole
empire
collapsed
in
late
1996
dre
retaliated
by
forming
a
new
company
aftermath
and
while
it
was
initially
slow
getting
started
his
bold
moves
forward
earned
critical
respect
dre
(born
andre
young
february
18
1965)
became
involved
in
hiphop
during
the
early
'80s
performing
at
house
parties
and
clubs
with
the
world
class
wreckin'
cru
around
south
central
los
angeles
and
making
a
handful
of
recordings
along
the
way
in
1986
he
met
ice
cube
and
the
two
rappers
began
writing
songs
for
ruthless
records
a
label
started
by
former
drug
pusher
eazye
eazy
tried
to
give
one
of
the
duo's
songs
boyznthe
hood
to
hbo
a
group
signed
to
ruthless
when
the
group
refused
eazy
formed
nwa

an
acronym
for
niggaz
with
attitude

with
dre
and
cube
releasing
their
first
album
in
1987
a
year
later
nwa
delivered
straight
outta
compton
a
vicious
hardcore
record
that
became
an
underground
hit
with
virtually
no
support
from
radio
the
press
or
mtv
nwa
became
notorious
for
their
hardcore
lyrics
especially
those
of
fuck
tha
police
which
resulted
in
the
fbi
sending
a
warning
letter
to
ruthless
and
its
parent
company
priority
suggesting
that
the
group
should
watch
their
step
most
of
the
group's
political
threat
left
with
cube
when
he
departed
in
late
1989
amid
many
financial
disagreements
while
eazy
appeared
to
be
the
undisputed
leader
following
cube's
departure

and
he
was
certainly
responsible
for
the
group
approaching
nearparodic
levels
with
their
final
pair
of
records

the
music
was
in
dre's
hands
on
both
the
1990
ep
100
miles
and
runnin'
and
the
1991
album
efil4zaggin
(niggaz4life
spelled
backward)
he
created
dense
funky
sonic
landscapes
that
were
as
responsible
for
keeping
nwa
at
the
top
of
the
charts
as
eazy's
comicbook
lyrics
while
the
group
was
at
the
peak
of
their
popularity
in
1991
dre
began
to
make
efforts
to
leave
the
crew
especially
after
he
was
charged
with
assaulting
the
host
of
a
televised
rap
show
in
1991
the
following
year
dre
left
the
group
to
form
death
row
records
with
suge
knight
according
to
legend
knight
held
nwa's
manager
at
gunpoint
and
threatened
to
kill
him
if
he
refused
to
let
dre
out
of
his
contract
dre
released
his
first
solo
single
deep
cover
in
the
spring
of
1992
not
only
was
the
record
the
debut
of
his
elastic
gfunk
sound
it
also
was
the
beginning
of
his
collaboration
with
rapper
snoop
doggy
dogg
dre
discovered
snoop
through
his
stepbrother
warren
g
and
he
immediately
began
working
with
the
rapper

snoop
was
on
dre's
1992
debut
the
chronic
as
much
as
dre
himself
thanks
to
the
singles
nuthin'
but
a
'g'
thang
dre
day
and
let
me
ride
the
chronic
was
a
multiplatinum
top
ten
smash
and
the
entire
world
of
hiphop
changed
with
it
for
the
next
four
years
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
hear
mainstream
hiphop
that
wasn't
effected
in
some
way
by
dre
and
his
patented
gfunk
not
only
did
he
produce
snoop's
1993
debut
doggystyle
but
he
orchestrated
several
soundtracks
including
above
the
rim
and
murder
was
the
case
(both
1994)
which
functioned
as
samplers
for
his
new
artists
and
production
techniques
and
he
helmed
hit
records
such
as
blackstreet's
no
diggity
among
others
including
a
hit
reunion
with
ice
cube
natural
born
killaz
during
this
entire
time
dre
released
no
new
records
but
he
didn't
need
to

all
of
death
row
was
under
his
control
and
most
of
his
peers
mimicked
his
techniques
the
death
row
dynasty
held
strong
until
the
spring
of
1996
when
dre
grew
frustrated
with
knight's
strongarm
techniques
at
the
time
death
row
was
devoting
itself
to
2pac's
label
debut
all
eyez
on
me
(which
featured
dre
on
the
breakthrough
hit
california
love)
and
snoop
was
busy
recovering
from
his
draining
murder
trial
dre
left
the
label
in
the
summer
of
1996
to
form
aftermath
declaring
gangsta
rap
dead
while
he
was
subjected
to
endless
taunts
from
his
former
death
row
colleagues
their
sales
slipped
by
1997
and
knight
was
imprisoned
on
racketeering
charges
by
the
end
of
the
year
dre's
first
album
for
aftermath
the
variousartists
collection
dr
dre
presentsthe
aftermath
received
considerable
media
attention
but
the
record
didn't
become
a
hit
despite
the
presence
of
his
hit
single
been
there
done
that
even
though
the
album
wasn't
a
success
the
implosion
of
death
row
in
1997
proved
that
dre's
inclinations
were
correct
at
the
time
both
2001
and
its
companion
instrumental
version
followed
in
1999
