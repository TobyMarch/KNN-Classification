boston
massachusetts
united
states
(1986
–
1993

2004
–
present)
pixies
are
an
american
alternative
rock
band
which
formed
in
boston
massachusetts
united
states
in
1986
the
band
consists
of
charles
(black
francis)
thompson
iv
(vocals
guitar
also
known
as
‘’frank
black’‘)
joey
santiago
(lead
guitar)
and
david
lovering
(drums)
until
2013
the
band
also
featured
kim
deal
on
bass
and
vocals
the
band
officially
split
in
1993
and
reunited
in
2004
they
went
on
hiatus
in
2007
with
each
band
member
pursuing
projects
of
their
own
only
to
reunite
in
2009
with
the
announcement
of
a
new
tour
commencing
in
europe
that
summer
although
quite
popular
on
alternative
rock
radio
in
the
united
states
due
to
heavy
airplay
of
the
singles
“monkey
gone
to
heaven”
and
“here
comes
your
man”
they
were
never
widely
popular
there
but
found
success
in
europe
especially
in
the
uk
(where
they
managed
three
top
40
singles
“velouria”
“planet
of
sound”
and
a
rerelease
of
“debaser”)
and
belgium
and
the
netherlands
where
they
were
heavily
broadcasted
by
alternative
public
radio
the
band’s
style
of
alternative
rock
music
is
heavily
influenced
by
punk
and
surf
rock
and
while
highly
melodic
is
capable
of
being
tremendously
abrasive
at
the
same
time
francis
is
the
pixies’
primary
songwriter
and
singer
and
has
a
distinctly
desperate
yowling
delivery
he
has
typically
written
cryptic
songs
about
offbeat
subjects
such
as
ufos
and
surrealism
references
to
mental
instability
violent
biblical
imagery
and
physical
injury
feature
in
many
of
the
band’s
songs
