there
are
multiple
artists
tracked
as
“nirvana”
on
lastfm
following
are
six
listed
in
order
of
prominence
1)
nirvana
was
a
popular
and
highly
influential
american
grunge
band
the
band
formed
in
aberdeen
washington
in
1987
and
was
part
of
the
seattle
grunge
scene
of
the
late
80s
other
seattle
grunge
bands
such
as
pearl
jam
alice
in
chains
and
soundgarden
also
gained
in
popularity
and
as
a
result
alternative
rock
became
a
dominant
genre
on
american
and
canadian
radio
and
music
television
during
the
earlytomid
’90s
nirvana’s
initial
incarnation
consisted
of
kurt
cobain
on
guitar
and
vocals
bassist
krist
novoselic
and
drummer
chad
channing
after
a
brief
stint
as
a
fourpiece
in
1989
with
the
addition
of
second
guitarist
jason
everman
followed
soon
after
by
the
replacement
of
channing
on
drums
in
1990
the
band
found
the
lineup
that
would
form
the
core
of
the
group
when
they
added
former
scream
drummer
dave
grohl
as
nirvana’s
frontman
cobain
found
himself
referred
to
in
the
media
as
the
“spokesman
of
a
generation”
with
nirvana
the
“flagship
band”
of
“generation
x”
cobain
was
uncomfortable
with
the
attention
and
placed
his
focus
on
the
band’s
music
challenging
the
band’s
audience
with
their
much
more
abrasive
third
studio
album
in
utero
considered
to
be
a
conscious
attempt
to
shed
their
audience
while
nirvana’s
mainstream
popularity
waned
in
the
months
following
its
release
their
core
audience
cherished
the
band’s
dark
interior
particularly
after
their
1993
performance
on
mtv
unplugged
with
the
meat
puppets
a
band
that
cobain
had
always
idolised
performing
with
them
the
songs
oh
me
plateau
and
lake
of
fire
