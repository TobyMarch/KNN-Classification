prehistory
the
take
it
to
the
limit
band
(1987)
and
her
satanic
majesty's
paycheck
(1989)
[edit]
the
definitive
beginning
of
golden
smog
is
hard
to
pinpoint
given
the
mercurial
nature
of
the
band's
lineup
however
some
claim
that
the
group
that
would
evolve
into
golden
smog
debuted
in
january
1987
when
a
band
billed
as
'the
take
it
to
the
limit
band'
played
an
(almost)
alleagles
cover
show
at
the
uptown
bar
in
minneapolis
this
band
consisted
of
dan
murphy
and
dave
pirner
(both
of
soul
asylum)
jim
boquist
(later
of
son
volt)
and
martin
zellar
(gear
daddies)
the
show
ended
with
a
cover
of
then
bangles
hit
song
walk
like
an
egyptian
this
same
group
later
played
a
rolling
stonesthemed
show
in
1989
under
the
band
name
her
satanic
majesty's
paycheck
first
incarnation
(1989–1998)
[edit]
the
group
first
came
together
under
the
name
golden
smog
in
the
minneapolis
area
in
1989
the
band
was
conceived
as
a
countryrock
reaction
to
the
punk
and
hardcore
music
that
dominated
the
twin
cities'
musical
scene
at
the
time
eventually
golden
smog
became
something
of
a
fixture
at
local
clubs
where
they
would
play
a
handful
of
shows
annually
consisting
almost
entirely
of
cover
songs
membership
in
the
early
days
of
the
band
was
loose
and
fluid
but
in
1992
dan
murphy
and
dave
pirner
of
soul
asylum
gary
louris
and
marc
perlman

run
and
drummer
chris
mars
(of
the
replacements)
released
golden
smog's
first
cd
a
covers
ep
entitled
on
golden
smog
all
of
the
band
members
were
credited
under
pseudonyms
for
this
release
as
a
result
of
contractual
obligations
to
other
record
companies
guest
vocalist
bill
sullivan
just
didn't
want
his
name
on
the
project
over
the
next
few
years
members
of
golden
smog
began
adding
original
material
to
the
group's
repertoire
although
cover
songs
would
continue
to
be
featured
in
concert
and
on
record
throughout
their
career
in
1995
the
group
released
its
fulllength
debut
down
by
the
old
mainstream
(recorded
at
pachyderm
recording
studio)
consisting
of
mostly
original
songs
with
a
handful
of
covers
by
this
time
mars

left

the

drummer
noah

as
with
the
band's
debut
ep

under
pseudonyms
(which
consisted
of
their
middle
names
and
the
names
of
the
streets
where
they
grew
up)
as
performers—although
they
all
used
their
real
names
in
the
writing
credits
at
a
new
year's
eve
show
in
1996/97
jody

band
member
golden

then
released
their
second
fulllength
