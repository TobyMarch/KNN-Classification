hello
friends
and
fans&nbsp
&nbsp
monique
and
i
would
like
to
thank
all
of
you
who
took
the
time
to
write
in
with
such
kind
and
thoughtful
well
wishes
on
december
28th
my
(well
let's
not
use
that
word)
ok?
i
prefer
not
to
think
of
it
as
getting
older
rather
like
a
fine
wine
a
vintage
les
paul
or
a
stradivariusmy
tone
is
mellowing
becoming
richer
and
improving
with
every
year
&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp
therefore
to
all
of
you
out
there
whoever
you
are
and
whatever
(that
day)
may
behey
we're
not
getting
older
we're
getting
better
so
to
all
of
us
happy
b
dayb
for
better!&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp
&nbsp

&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp
keep
