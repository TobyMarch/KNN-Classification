[edit]

seriously
injured
in
a
vehicle
accident
on
the
night
of
october
5
2006
when
a
commercial
truck
collided
with
his
suv
while
he
was
a
passenger
he
was
taken
to
the
jersey
city
medical
center
where
he
was
diagnosed
with
a
fractured
skull
and
several
broken
bones
on
the
left
side
of
his
face
he
still
has
visible
scars
from
the
accident[23][24][25]
“
i
was
in
a
coma
for
about
seven
or
eight
days
he
said
and
then
they
put
me
into
a
medicated
coma
so
that
if
i
woke
up
i
wouldn't
be
traumatized
by
what
i
went
through
when
i
first
woke
up
out
of
my
coma
i
had
amnesia
so
i
couldn't
really
remember
everything
i
didn't
have
full
amnesia
i
could
remember
certain
things
the
only
people
i
really
knew
were
my
mom
my
son
people
that's
real
close
that
you
knew
all
your
life
i
knew
their
names
but
even
certain
experiences
i
couldn't
remember
at
first
i
couldn't
remember
none
of
my
raps
even
the
songs
i
performed
—
'hotel'
'i'm
a
hustla'
none
of
that
the
doctor
told
me
that
i
suffered
brain
damage
but
it
was
temporary
it
wasn't
permanent
so
the
same
way
it
takes
time
for
your
body
to
heal
he
said
it's
gonna
take
your
brain
time
to
heal
