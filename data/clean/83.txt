@depechemode
originally
a
product
of
britain's
new
romantic
movement
depeche
mode
went
on
to
become
the
quintessential
electropop
band
of
the
1980s
one
of
the
first
acts
to
establish
a
musical
identity
based
completely
around
the
use
of
synthesizers
they
began
their
existence
as
a
bouncy
dancepop
outfit
but
gradually
developed
a
darker
more
dramatic
sound
that
ultimately
positioned
them
as
one
of
the
most
successful
alternative
bands
of
their
era
the
roots
of
depeche
mode
date
to
1976
when
basildon
englandbased
keyboardists
vince
clarke
and
andrew
fletcher
first
teamed
to
form
the
group
no
romance
in
china
the
band
proved
shortlived
and
by
1979
clarke
had
formed
french
look
another
duo
featuring
guitarist/keyboardist
martin
gore
fletcher
soon
signed
on
and
the
group
rechristened
itself
composition
of
sound
initially
clarke
handled
vocal
chores
but
in
1980
singer
david
gahan
was
brought
in
to
complete
the
lineup
after
one
final
name
change
to
depeche
mode
the
quartet
members
jettisoned
all
instruments
excluding
their
synthesizers
honing
a
slick
technobased
sound
to
showcase
clarke's
catchy
melodies
after
building
a
following
on
the
london
club
scene
depeche
mode
debuted
in
1980
with
photographic
a
track
included
on
the
some
bizzare
album
label
compilation
after
signing
to
mute
records
they
issued
dreaming
of
me
in
early
1981
while
neither
the
single
nor
its
followup
new
life
caused
much
of
a
stir
their
third
effort
just
can't
get
enough
became
a
top
ten
uk
hit
and
their
1981
debut
lp
speak
and
spell
was
also
a
success
just
as
depeche
mode
appeared
poised
for
a
major
commercial
breakthrough
however
principal
songwriter
clarke
abruptly
exited
to
form
yazoo
with
singer
alison
moyet
leaving
the
group's
future
in
grave
doubt
as
gore
grabbed
the
band's
songwriting
reins
the
remaining
trio
recruited
keyboardist
alan
wilder
to
fill
the
technological
void
created
by
clarke's
departure
while
1982's
a
broken
frame
deviated
only
slightly
from
depeche
mode's
earlier
work
gore's
ominous
songs
grew
more
assured
and
sophisticated
by
the
time
of
1983's
construction
time
again
some
great
reward
issued
the
following
year
was
their
artistic
and
commercial
breakthrough
as
gore's
dark
kinky
preoccupations
with
spiritual
doubt
(blasphemous
rumours)
and
psychosexual
manipulation
(master
and
servant)
came
to
the
fore
the
egalitarian
single
people
are
people
was
a
major
hit
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
and
typified
the
music's
turn
toward
more
industrial
textures
released
in
1986
the
atmospheric
black
celebration
continued
the
trend
toward
grim
melancholy
and
further
established
the
group
as
a
commercial
force
it
eventually
sold
over
500000
copies
in
the
us
which
earned
it
gold
status
released
in
1987
music
for
the
masses
featuring
three
hot
100
singles
in
strangelove
never
let
me
down
again
and
behind
the
wheel
propelled
the
group
into
the
mainstream
the
album
would
sell
over
a
million
copies
in
the
us
alone
a
subsequent
soldout
tour
yielded
the
1989
double
live
set
101
recorded
at
the
rose
bowl
in
pasadena
california
it
was
accompanied
by
a
concert
film
directed
by
the
legendary
da
pennebaker
with
the
alternative
music
boom
of
the
early
'90s
depeche
mode
emerged
as
one
of
the
world's
most
successful
acts
the
tripleplatinum
violator
released
in
1990
was
a
top
ten
smash
that
spawned
the
hits
personal
jesus
(a
number
eight
single)
enjoy
the
silence
policy
of
truth
and
world
in
my
eyes
their
1993
lp
songs
of
faith
and
devotion

featuring
a
significant
change
in
its
heavy
use
of
electric
guitars

entered
the
charts
in
the
number
one
slot
however
at
the
peak
of
its
success
the
group
began
to
unravel
beginning
with
wilder's
1995
exit
gahan
attempted
to
take
his
own
life
and
later
entered
a
drug

addiction
to

depeche
