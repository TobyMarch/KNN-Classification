playwright
rolin
jones
and
director
jackson
gay
would
agree
with
most
theater
professionals
that
shakespeare
reigns
as
boss
among
dramatists
of
all
time
and
though
the
bard
like
the
colosseum
and
the
louvre
museum
is
tops
neither
jones
nor
gay
feel
that
he
deserves
a
free
pass
on
the
stickier
issues
in
some
of
his
plays
their
latest
collaboration
“these
paper
bullets!”
is
the
result
of
their
desire
to
fix
the
flaws
in
“much
ado
about
nothing”
&nbsp
“these
