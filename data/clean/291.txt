cd
those
who
have
an
original
vinyl
copy
of
this
album
will
remember
the
liner
notes
ie
a
collection
of
the
various
band
members'
favourite
colours
favourite
places
their
zodiac
signs
and
random
thoughts
(the
comment
about
stephen
stills
showing
up
in
his
profile)
when
i
began
to
delve
into
classic
rock
of
the
'60s
in
my
teens
(20
years
too
late
i
have
often
lamented)
this
was
one
of
the
albums
i
picked
upyes
an
actual
lp
i
used
to
have
quite
a
collection
of
those
although
it
might
not
rival
some
in
1997
when
the
new
remaster
was
released
with
the
mono
and
stereo
versions
of
the
album
put
together
on
one
cd
i
rediscovered
this
album
in
all
its
glory
it's
not
perfectwhat
debut
album
is?but
it
was
pretty
damned
good
for
a
first
record
(can't
say
that
for
all
of
them)
the
remaster
featured
the
mono
version
atco
originally
released
in
december
of
'66
which
featured
a
different
running
orderleave
was
track
3
side
1
and
baby
don't
scold
me
appeared
as
track
5
side
2
the
latter
was
a
nice
little
song
with
steve
and
richie
furay
sharing
lead
vocals
including
an
instrumental
quote
from
the
beatles'
day
tripper
(the
familiar
riff)
and
as
the
notes
on
the
remaster
indicate
mono
was
how
the
band
intended
this
album
we
never
had
a
chance
at
the
stereo
they
say
indicating
that
their
producers
(charles
stone

brian
green
iirc)
snapped
up
that
chance
for
themselves
they
proceeded
to
remix
the
album
removing
baby
don't
scold
me
and
replacing
it
with
the
band's
big
hit
for
what
it's
worth
which
became
track
1
side
1
and
leave
relegated
to
the
position
of
track
5
side
2
that
version
released
as
atco
sd33200a
in
april
of
'67
is
the
one
i
bought
some
20
years
later
on
vinyl
and
makes
up
the
second
half
of
the
remastered
cd
the
sound
on
both
versions
is
much
improved
the
remaster
is
an
hdcd
(high
definition
cd)
with
warmer
sound
than
had
been
possible
before
in
digital
unfortunately
this
cd
is
now
out
of
print
the
buffalo
springfield
box
set
which
rhino
released
in
2001
rectified
that
by
putting
remastered
versions
of
this
album
and
again
the
band's
more
famous
sophomore
effort
(and
the
one
the
critics
like
the
best)
together
on
the
4th
disc
in
that
set
that
version
of
the
first
album
includes
the
original
mono
running
order
with
for
what
it's
worth
sandwiched
in
between
the
2
albums
as
a
bonus
track
what
rhino
ought
imo
to
do
this
year
this
being
the
40th
anniversary
of
buffalo
springfield's
forming
signing
to
atlantic
and
recording/releasing
their
debut
album
is
remaster
all
3
of
the
band's
original
studio
albums
complete
with
bonus
tracks
from
each
lp's
original
studio
sessions
especially
since
this
is
how
classic
albums
are
now
being
presented
(yes'
atlantic
catalogue
donovan's
studio
albums
still
others
too
numerous
to
mention
here)
and
maybe
we
can
consider
sacd
remasters?

cd
buffalo
springfield
is
the
debut
selftitled
album
of
a
sixties
band
consisting
of
neil
young
(lead
guitarvocals)
stephen
stills
(2nd
lead
guitar
vocals)
richie
furay
(rhythm
guitarvocals)
dewey
martin
(drums)
and
bruce
palmer
(bass
guitar)
later
replaced
by
jim
messina
this
record
was
made
in
1966
and
debuted
in
mono
with
baby
don't
scold
me
which
was
replaced
by
for
what
it's
worth
in
the
stereo
version
this
record
is
a
great
introduction
to
what
the
group
had
to
come
their
first
production
portrayed
more
than
any
other
album
the
folkrock
style
of
music
that
buffalo
springfield
was
accustomed
to
(and
excellent
at
making)
it
is
full
of
easy
to
listen
vocals
and
guitar
playing
during
this
first
phase
of
the
band
richie
furay
was
the
lead
singer
in
most
of
the
songs
this
was
at
a
time
when
neil
young
was
unsure
about
his
voice
so
of
young's
four
songs
on
the
album
(burned
out
of
my
mind
flying
on
the
ground
is
wrong
and
do
i
have
to
come
right
out
and
say
it)
richie
furay
sang
the
latter
two
of
them
stephen
stills'
for
what
it's
worth
is
no
doubt
the
group's
most
popular
song
rated
the
63rd
greatest
song
of
all
time
by
rolling
stone
magazine
there
are
also
a
few
other
great
songs
by
stills
on
this
record
since
this
album
was
their
first
it
was
an
ambitious
piece
it
was
also
made
during
a
time
when
the
group
was
going
strong
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
group's
last
album
this
piece
of
work
is
full
of
awesome
guitar
playing
as
one
would
think
from
a
band
with
four
guitar
players
four
songs
from
this
album
were
included
in
the
greatest
hits
album
but
a
few
others
could
have
been
added
without
question
many
people
compare
buffalo
springfield
with
the
more
popular
byrds
these
two
groups
were
both
very
successful
pioneers
of
folkrock
music
buffalo
springfield
succumbed
to
internal
conflicts
when
they
broke
up
in
1968
the
group
made
only
three
lp's
and
later
a
greatest
hits
album
if
you
haven't
heard
of
buffalo
springfield
you
have
probably
heard
of
a
branch
of
them
richie
furay
went
on
to
be
the
lead
singer
in
the
folkrock
group
poco
and
later
in
the
souther
hillman
and
furay
band
and
the
richie
furay
band
steven
stills
joined
graham
nash
and
david
crosby
in
crosby
stills
and
nash
he
also
had
a
successful
solo
career
neil
young
joined
crosby
stills
and
nash
to
form
crosby
stills
nash
and
young
and
had
probably
the
most
successful
solo
career
of
all
the
members
dewey
martin
and
bruce
palmer
were
not
heard
of
much
afterwards
and
did
nothing
really
significant
after
buffalo
springfield
when
mentioning
folkrock
music
buffalo
springfield
cannot
be
excluded
as
they
were
one
of
the
most
talented
of
their
time
this
album
surely
will
not
let
you
down
if
you
are
a
true
classic
rock
fan

cd
now
this
is
the
type
of
reissue
i'd
like
to
see
more
of
the
album
is
presented
in
the
mono
and
stereo
mixes
with
the
first
version
of
the
album
(featuring
baby
don't
scold
me
an
unremarkable
but
fine
track)
being
the
mono
version
and
the
second
version
(featuring
for
what
it's
worth
instead
of
baby
don't
scold
me)
this
album
is
mostly
notable
for
some
of
neil
young's
earliest
songwriting
including
the
wellknown
classic
nowadays
clancy
can't
even
sing
well
worth
it
for
diehard
springfield
fans
but
casual
fans
and
the
curious
might
prefer
the
older
stereoonly
cd
if
only
because
it's
cheaper

cd
buffalo
springfield
was
neither
the
first
vehicle
for
nor
the
first
group
to
record
and
release
works
by
founding
members
richie
furay
stephen
stills
and
neil
young
rather
it
was
a
sounding
board
and
a
starting
point
for
a
new
direction
in
rock
and
the
beginning
of
stardom
for
its
aforementioned
members
(and
even
later
jim
messina
of
loggins
and
messina
fame)
stephen
stills
would
emerge
as
the
group's
main
songwriter
but
as
with
crosby
stills
nash
and
young
he
would
soon
be
surpassed
for
quality
of
work
by
peer
and
colleague
neil
young
the
dynamics
between
the
two
are
simultaneously
famous
and
infamous
yet
the
mutual
admiration
and
inspiration
is
evident
on
this
and
all
future
stillsyoung
projects
emerging
at
a
time
when
the
beatles
had
led
the
british
rock
brigade
into
america
and
the
us
had
replied
with
the
dylaninspired
folk
rock
of
the
byrds
and
the
mamas
and
the
papas
the
buffalo
springfield
would
introduce
more
of
a
country
flavor
to
the
spectrum
(a
la
the
band
latterday
byrds
creedence
clearwater
revival
and
the
flying
burrito
brothers)
like
the
band
springfield
would
include
both
americans
and
canadians
just
as
csny
would
add
an
englishman
and
former
hollie
to
the
mix
not
necessarily
making
this
a
melting
pot
it
does
bring
to
the
fore
different
cultural
elements
and
an
innovative
blend
of
ideas
this
release
serves
as
an
appropriate
crash
course
to
the
form
both
in
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
as
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
musical
careers
of
stephen
stills
and
neil
young
(furay's
light
not
shining
quite
as
brightly
even
though
he
would
achieve
some
standard
of
success
with
poco)
as
the
saying
goes
the
best
is
yet
to
come!
