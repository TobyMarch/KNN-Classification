was
an
influential
hip

originally
formed

new
york
city
in
1985
the
group
is
composed
of
qtip
phife
dawg
and
dj
ali
shaheed
muhammad
a
fourth
member
jarobi
white
was
an
intermittent
collaborator
appearing
on
their
first
album
but
he
left
the
group
soon
after
although
he
is
mentioned
as
a
‘sometimes’
member
on
their
third
album
liner
notes
along
with
de
la
soul
and
jungle
brothers
the
group
was
a
central
part
of
the
native
tongues
posse
and
enjoyed
the
most
commercial
success
out
of
all
the
groups
to
emerge
from
that
collective
qtip
and
phife
had
grown
up
together
in
queens
and
met
muhammad
in
high
school
the
group’s
name
was
coined
by
the
jungle
brothers
whose
members
attended
the
same
school
soon
after
the
group
began
performing
live
and
recording
on
a
local
label
the
group
became
a
part
of
the
native
tongues
family
a
hiphop
artist
collective
also
consisting
of
the
groups
jungle
brothers
de
la
soul
and
black
sheep
at
the
time
of
their
inception
a
tribe
called
quest
was
unique
within
the
hiphop
community
for
eschewing
gangsta
rap
and
macho
posturing
their
lyrics
focused
on
abstract
and
social
issues
such
as
the
word
“nigger”
date
rape
and
consumerism
musically
the
group
helped
pioneer
the
jazzrap
style
(along
with
groups
such
as
gang
starr
and
de
la
soul)
they
made
their
studio
debut
in
1990
with
people’s
instinctive
travels
and
the
paths
of
rhythm

i
actually
think
beats
rhymes
and
life
is
the
group's
weakest
effort
which
is
amazing
to
me
because
dilla's
other
production
around
that
time
(labcabincalifornia
fantastic
vol
1)
are
awesome
i
think
tip

ali
shaheed
were
just
finding
their
footing
the
love
moment
just
sounds
more
confident
