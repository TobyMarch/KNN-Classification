with
grit

grind
it
was
evident
that
e40
was
moving
towards
a
more
stridently
hyphy
clubinfluenced
sound
grit

grind
and
breakin'
news
were
transitional
efforts
(anticipating
the
sound
of
tell
me
when
to
goonwards)
and
both
(mostly
grit

grind)
have
some
of
his
best
music
basically
if
you
like
what
e40’s
doing
at
the
moment
then
peep
everything
he’s
done
since
2002
(grit

grind
my
ghetto
report
card
and
his
recent
block
brochures
are
in
my
opinion
his
best
albums/series
in
this
timeframe)
e40
is
making
good
music
at
the
moment
but
i
think
his
best
run
(with
the
exception
of
the
filler
in
the
element
of
surprise)
was
the
midlate
‘90s
tha
hall
of
game
and
charlie
hu$tle
are
probably
his
third
and
fourth
best
efforts
respectively
rappers
like
e40
that
have
personality
and
ability
in
spades
are
the
dudes
that
always
bring
me
back
to
hiphop…

simoneperrota
in
a
major
way
is
just
about
40
water's
best
album
followed
closely
by
grit

grind
e40
is
an
acquired
taste
for
a
lot
of
people
(as
is
almost
all
mobb/hyphy
music)
but
if
you're
willing
to
give
his
music
a
chance
the
rewards
can
be
great
some
of
his
'90s
music
sounds
slightly
amateurish
productionwise
but
that's
part
of
the
charm
this
is
primarily
because
the
emphasis
was
heavier
on
the
mc
back
then
although
the
production
e40
receives
today
though
different
in
sound
is
still
often
solely
designed
to
facilitate
his
scattershot
flow
and
offthewall
delivery
in
the
'90s
e40
was
all
about
spitting
pure
game
and
spinning
off
all
types
of
leftfield
gangsta
rap
scenarios
over
sparse
beats
with
exceptionally
flatulent
bass
lines
and
quirky
synths
today
he's
more
about
the
current
bay
hiphop
lifestyle
and
his
status
as
a
regional
figurehead
fonzarelli
is
also
generally
considerably
more
open
to
different
sounds
