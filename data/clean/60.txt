it's
cary

and
you

the

who

are
is
a
soulful
album
with
an
indie

listen

cary
will
surprise
you
with
his
passion

melodies
especially
worth
noting
are
the
bluesy
aching
blue
eyes
(bonus
song)
beautiful
wistful
jealousy
with
its
great
piano
riffs
the
gorgeous
lyrics
and
melody
of
glass

and
the
delicate
guitar
melodies
of
the
thompson

cover
if
you
were
here
although
all
of
cary's
melodies
are
strong
i
didn't

for
some

the
lyrics
(honestly)
how
many
songs
about

gone
bad

stoned

can
you
listen

same
for

awhile
the
majority
however
are
thoughtful
confessions
mainly
from
the
heart
in
the
title
track
as
well
as
in
the
thompson
twins
cover
cary
gives
a
nod
to
the
bands
of
the
mid80's
a
growing

that

cd
cary
brothers'
who
you
are
is
authentically
simple
warms
your
heart
with
lyric
and
melody
and
brings
on
fullyfelt
reminders
of
a
beautiful
summer's
day
it's
poprock
at
its
best
cary's
gripping
and
sensuallyhonest
vocals
and
songwriting
flourish
within
the
beautiful
melodies
throughout
the
album
are
hints
of
numerous
generation
wonders
such
as
u2
the
cure
and
coldplay
with
his
songs
having
played
on
numerous
television
shows
such
as
nbc's
scrubs
fox's
bones
and
grey's
anatomy
most
likely
you
have
heard
his
music
it
is
music
deserving
of
much
more
airplay
no
overproduction
here
it
is
mostly
organic
sounds
with
tinges
of
electronic
effects
producer
chad
fischer
thankfully
does
not
appear
to
manipulate
brothers'
talent
in
the
studio
because
the
heart
and
soul
that
went
into
the
album
was
captured
and
comes
through
in
the
audio
the
highlights
are
ride
[from
2006's
the
last
kiss
soundtrack]
honestly
a
very
downtempo
mellowing
vibe
with
touching
lyrics
and
melodies
the
slickly
hooked
and
grooved
think
awhile
all
the
rage
a
mellow
smooth
sensually
spacious
rerelease
track
from
brother's
ep
[taking
a
welldeserved
place
on
the
album]
and
precious
lie
a
poignant
beautiful
song
that
takes
the
album
out

at
least
until
the
secret
final
track
blue
eyes
makes
its
way
as
track
fourteen
who
you

who

is
that
