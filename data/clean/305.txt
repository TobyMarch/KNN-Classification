biography
hertfordshire
united
kingdom
(1968
–
1976
1984
–
present)
deep
purple
is
an
english
rock
band
formed
in
hertfordshire
in
1968
together
with
led
zeppelin
and
black
sabbath
they
are
considered
to
be
heavy
metal
pioneers
especially
influential
to
heavy
metal
were
ian
gillan’s
powerful
screams
and
ritchie
blackmore’s
virtuoso
solos
deep
purple
were
also
very
influential
to
progressive
rock
deep
purple’s
early
output
ranged
from
rock
(such
as
their
cover
of
joe
south’s
“hush)”
to
strongly
classically
influenced
pieces
(such
as
“april”
from
their
third
album)
their
first
few
albums
contained
very
long
solos
such
as
those
on
the
band’s
covers
of
“hey
joe”
and
“i’m
so
glad”
after
their
third
album
founding
member
and
guitarist
ritchie
blackmore
in
particular
felt
the
band
should
move
in
a
harder
direction

and
felt
that
then
singer
rod
evans
and
bassist
nicky
simper
were
incapable
of
working
in
that
direction
both
were
therefore
let
go
and
replaced
with
singer
ian
gillan
and
bassist
roger
glover
from
episode
six
producing
what
is
now
thought
of
as
the
classic
deep
purple
lineup
with
keyboardist
jon
lord
and
drummer
ian
paice
the
first
output
of
this
new
lineup
was
a
mixed
electric
and
orchestral
album
with
the
london
philharmonic
orchestra
deep
purple
in
concert
with
the
centrepiece
being
lord’s
“concerto
for
group
and
orchestra”
the
whole
project
was
reputedly
initiated
after
idle
chat
with
the
band’s
manager
about
the
possibility
led
to
him
book
the
orchestra
and
give
the
inexperienced
composer
a
deadline
to
produce
the
work
of
a
public
concert
following
on
from
this
unusual
venture
were
four
very
influential
studio
albums
over
the
next
four
years
