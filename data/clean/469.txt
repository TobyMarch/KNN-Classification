career
[edit]
1989–1990
breakthrough
success
[edit]
garth
brooks'
eponymous
first
album
was
released
in
1989
and
was
a
critical
and
chart
success
it
peaked
at
number
2
in
the
us
country
album
chart
and
reached
number
13
on
the
billboard
200
pop
album
chart
most
of
the
album
was
traditionalist
country
influenced
in
part
by
george
strait[13]
the
first
single
much
too
young
(to
feel
this
damn
old)
was
a
country
top
10
success
it
was
followed
by
his
first
country
numberone
if
tomorrow
never
comes
not
counting
you
reached
number
2
and
then
the
dance
put
him
at
numberone
again
this
song's
theme
of
people
dying
while
doing
something
they
believe
in
resonated
strongly
and
together
with
a
popular
music
video
directed
by
john
lloyd
miller
gave
brooks
his
first
push
towards
a
broader
audience
brooks
has
claimed
that
out
of
all
the
songs
he
has
recorded
the
dance
is
his
favorite[13]
his
followup
album
no
fences
was
released
in
1990
and
spent
23
weeks
as
numberone
on
the
billboard
country
music
chart[23]
the
album
also
reached
number
3
on
the
pop
chart
and
eventually
became
brooks's
highestselling
album
with
domestic
shipments
of
17
million[24]
it
contained
what
would
become
brooks's
signature
song
the
blue
collar
anthem
friends
in
low
places
as
well
as
two
other
brooks
classics
the
dramatic
and
controversial
the
thunder
rolls
and
the
philosophically
ironic
unanswered
prayers

each
of
these
songs
as
well
as
the
affectionate
two
of
a
kind
workin'
on
a
full
house
reached
numberone
on
the
country
chart[13][23]
while
brooks's
musical
style
placed
him
squarely
within
the
boundaries
of
country
music
he
was
strongly
influenced
by
the
1970s
singersongwriter
movement
especially
the
works
of
james
taylor
(whom
he
idolized
and
named
his
first
child
after)
and
dan
fogelberg[25][26]
similarly
brooks
was
influenced
by
1970sera
rock
of
billy
joel
and
bruce
springsteen
and
the
operatic
rock
of
queen
with
freddie
mercury
in
his
highly
successful
live
shows
brooks
used
a
wireless
headset
microphone
to
free
himself
to
run
about
the
stage
adding
energy
and
arena
rock
theatrics
to
spice
up
the
normally
staid
country
music
approach
to
concerts
the
hard
rock
band
kiss
was
also
one
of
his
earliest
grade
school
musical
influences
and
his
shows
often
reflected
this
brooks
said
that
the
style
of
his
show
was
inspired
mostly
by
chris
ledoux[27]
brooks
has
been
a
member
of
the
grand
ole
opry
since
1990[28][29]
1991–93
ropin'
the
wind
and
the
chase
[edit]
brooks's
third
album
ropin'
the
wind
released
in
september
1991
had
advance
orders
of
4
million
copies
and
entered
the
pop
album
charts
at
numberone
a
first
for
a
country
act[12]
ropin'
the
wind's
music
was
a
melange
of
pop
country
and
honky
tonk
hits
included
billy
joel's
shameless
what
she's
doing
now
and
the
river
all
told
it
became
his
secondbest
selling
album
after
no
fences
the
success
of
this
album
further
propelled
the
sales
of
his
first
two
albums
enabling
brooks
to
become
the
first
country
artist
with
three
albums
listed
in
the
pop
top
20
in
one
week[30]
after
spending
time
in
los
angeles
during
the
1992
riots
brooks
cowrote
the
gospelcountryrock
hybrid
we
shall
be
free
to
express
his
desire
for
tolerance[31]
the
song
became
the
first
single
off
his
fourth
album
the
chase
it
only
reached
number
12
on
the
country
chart
his
first
song
in
three
years
to
fail
to
make
the
top
ten[32][33]
nevertheless
the
song
often
received
standing
ovations
when
performed
in
concert
went
to
number
22
in
the
christian
charts
through
a
marketing
deal
with
rick
hendrix
company
and
earned
brooks
a
1993
glaad
media
award[34][35]
following
we
shall
be
free
the
next
single
released
in
would
be
somewhere
other
than
the
night
which
peaked
at
number
1
in
late
1992
learning
to
live
again
a
number
2
hit
in
1993
the
final
single
off
of
the
chase
would
be
1993's
that
summer
which
would
go
on
to
be
the
most
successful
single
from
the
album
reaching
number
1
in
july
1993
it
is
also
one
of
brooks'
most
recognizable
songs
1993–94
in
pieces
[edit]
in
1993
garth
brooks
who
had
criticized
music
stores
which
sold
used
cds
since
it
led
to
a
loss
in
royalty
payments
persuaded
capitol
records
not
to
ship
his
august
1993
album
in
pieces
to
stores
which
engaged
in
this
practice
this
led
to
several
antitrust
lawsuits
against
the
record
label
and
ended
with
capitol
shipping
the
cds
to
the
stores
after
all[36]
despite
the
delay
in
shipping
the
album
to
certain
stores
in
pieces
was
another
instant
no
1
success
selling
a
total
of
about
10
million
copies
worldwide
some
of
his
fans
were
upset
however
that
the
album
was
not
released
simultaneously
around
the
world
in
the
united
kingdom
one
of

most
committed
fan
bases
outside
the
united
states
country
music
disc
jockeys
such
as
martin
campbell
and
john
wellington
noted
that
many
fans
were
buying
the
album
on
import
this
made
it
the
first
album
to
debut
in
the
top
10
of
the
uk
country
album
charts
before
its
official
release
date
once
officially
released
there
in
1994
the
album
reached
the
top
spot
on
the
uk
country
chart
albeit
a
particularly
niche
chart
where
few
sales
are
needed
to
make
the
top
slots
–
and
number
two
on
the
uk
pop
albums
chart
that
same
year
the
red
strokes
became
brooks's
first
single
to
make
the
pop
top
40
in
the
uk
reaching
a
high
of

it
was
followed
by
standing
outside

which
reached

previous

no

ropin'
the
wind
and
the
chase
also
remained
in
the
top
30
in
the
uk
to
support
the
album
brooks
embarked
on
a
1994
uk
tour
selling
out
venues
such
as
birmingham's
national
exhibition
centre
and
london's
wembley
arena
he
opened
the
london
radio
station
country
1035
and
made
a
number
of
general
television
and
radio
appearances
where
he
was
often
mocked
by
the
presenters
on
itv's
regional
news
show
london
tonight
brooks
was
described
as
a
topselling
rooting
tooting
cotton
picking
country
and
western
star
yeeha!
the
nationwide
big
breakfast
show's
presenters
chris
evans
and
paula
yates
commented
that
he's
selling
more
records
than
anyone
in
the
world
but
none
of
us
have
ever
heard
of
him
yates
then
told
brooks
that
country
singers
always
seem
to
be
weeping
over
the
dead
dog
and
things
and
also
remarked
i
thought
you'd
come
in
here
and
twiddle
your
pistol
around
and
be
impressed
although
brooks
remained
polite
he
did
observe
that
yates
was
obviously
unfamiliar
with
modern
country
music
scores
of
brooks
fans
later
wrote
to
complain
about
his
treatment
on
the
show
sometime
after
this
dwight
yoakam
appeared
on
the
same
show
and
after
yates
told
him
you
seem
different
from
other
country
singers
we've
had
on
the
show
yoakam
replied
what?
all
two
of
us?
despite
the
disdain
of
the
british
media
brooks's
overall
popularity
in
the
country
was
evident
with
a
top
disc
jockey
nick
barraclough
referring
to
brooks
as
garth
vader
(a
play
on
darth
vader)
for
his
invasion
of
the
charts
and
his
success
in
the
country
genre
unlike
alan
jackson
who
refused
to
return
to
the
uk
after
being
treated
in
a
similar
manner
by
the
press
brooks
returned
in
1996
for
more
soldout
concerts
although
this
time
his
media
appearances
were
mostly
restricted
to
country
radio
and
interviews
with
magazines
elsewhere
in
the
world
brooks
was
also
considered
a
star
and
he
enjoyed
hit
records
and
sellout
tours
in
regions
including
brazil
throughout
europe
the
far
east
new
zealand
and
australia[37]
in
1994
brooks
paid
homage
to
one
of
his
musical
influences
when
he
appeared
on
the
tribute
compilation
kiss
my
ass
classic
kiss
regrooved
a
collection
of
kiss
songs
performed
by
popular
artists
from
various
genres

instead
insisted

in
1999
brooks
and
his
production
company
red
strokes
entertainment
with
paramount
pictures
began
to
develop
a
movie
in
which
brooks
would
star
the
lamb
was
to
have
revolved
around
chris
gaines
a
fictional
rock
singer
and
his
emotionally
conflicted
life
as
a
musician
in
the
public
eye
to
create
buzz
for
the
project
brooks
took
on
the
identity
of
gaines
in
the
october
1999
album
garth
brooks
in

the
life
of
chris
gaines
which
was
intended
as
a
'presoundtrack'
to
the
film[39]
brooks
also
subsequently
appeared
as
gaines
in
a
television
mockumentary
for
the
vh1
series
behind
the

and
as
the
musical
guest
on
an
episode
of
saturday
night
live
which
he
hosted
as
himself
brooks's
endless
promotion
of
the
album
and
the
film
did
not
seem
to
stir
much
excitement
and
the
failure
of
the
chris
gaines
experiment
became
fairly
evident
mere
weeks
after
the
album
was
released
although
critics
admired
brooks
for
taking
a
musical
risk
the
majority
of
the
american
public
was
either
totally
bewildered
or
completely
unreceptive
to
the
idea
of
garth
brooks
as
anything
but
a
popcountry
singer[40]
many
of
his
fans
also
felt
that
by
supporting
the
gaines
project
they
would
lose
the
real
garth
brooks[41]
sales
of
the
album
were
unspectacular
and
although
it
made
it
to
number
2
on
the
pop
album
chart
expectations
had
been
higher
and
retail
stores
began
heavily
discounting
their
oversupply[42]
lessthanexpected
sales
of
the
album
(more
than
two
million)
and
no
further
developments
in
the
production
of
the
film
as
a
result
brought
the
project
to
an
indefinite
hiatus
in
february
2001
and
gaines
quickly
faded
into
obscurity[43]
despite
the
lessthanspectacular
response
to
the

official
retirement
[edit]
as
his
career
flourished
brooks
seemed
frustrated
by
the
conflicts
between
career
and
family
he
talked
of
retiring
from
performing
in
1992[32]
and
1995

the

levels
of

heyday

still
sold
comfortably
well
reaching

on
both

brooks
attempted
to
donate
part
of
his
liver
to
country
music
contemporary
and
close
friend
chris
ledoux
however
it
was
found
to

professional
baseball
[edit]
brooks
set
out
on
a
short
and
unsuccessful
career
in
baseball
when
he
signed
with
the
san
diego
padres
for
spring
training
in
1998
[67]
and
1999[68]
some
in
the
media
mocked
the
decision
of
the
padres
to
sign
a
country
music
star
in
his
late
thirties
whose
baseball
experience
ended
in
high
school[69]
brooks'
performance
on
the
field
did
not
warrant
management
placing
him
on
the
regular
season
roster
brooks
was
offered
a
nonroster
spot
but
declined
it[70]
the
following
season
brooks
signed
with
the
new
york
mets
this
time
his
team
embraced
the
entertainment
value
of
having
a
country
and
western
star
on
the
diamond[71]
this
springtraining
stint
was
also
a
poor
performance
for
brooks
however
resulting
in
a
zeroforseventeen
batting
record[72]
brooks
returned
to
baseball
one
last
time
for
an
encore
performance
with
the
kansas
city
royals
in
2004[73]
in
baseball
brooks
never
matched
the
amount
of
hits
he
was
able
to
achieve
on
the
music
charts
but
was
able
to
get
a
hit
off
mike
myers
during
his
final
springtraining
season
with
the
royals[citation
needed]
setting
records
[edit]
the
recording
industry
association
of
america
announced
that
garth
brooks
was
the
bestselling
solo
artist
of
the
20th
century
in
america[74]
this
conclusion
drew
criticism
from
the
press
and
many
music
fans
who
were
convinced
that
elvis
presley
had
sold
more
records
but
had
been
shortchanged
in
the
rankings
due
to
faulty
riaa
certification
methods
during
his
lifetime[75][76]
brooks
while
proud
of
his
sales
accomplishments
stated
that
he
too
believed
that
presley
must
have
sold
more[75]
the
riaa
has
since
reexamined
their
methods
for
counting
certifications
under
their
revised
methods
presley
became
the
bestselling
solo
artist
in
us
history
making
brooks
the
number
two
solo
artist
ranking
third
overall
as
the
beatles
have
sold
more
albums
than
either
he
or
presley[77]
the
revision
brought
more
criticism
of
the
accuracy
of
the
riaa's
figures
this
time
from
brooks's
followers
on
november
5
2007
brooks
was
again
named
the
best
selling
solo
artist
in
us
history
surpassing
presley
after
audited
sales
of
123
million
were
announced[78]
in
december
2010
several
more
of
presley's
albums
received
certifications
from
the
riaa
as
a
result
elvis
again
surpassed
brooks[79]
as
of
june
2012
the
riaa
lists
presley's
total
sales
at
1345
million
and
brooks's
at
128
million[80]
as
of
january
2012
brooks
officially
passed
the
beatles
as
the
topselling
act
of
the
past
20
years
moving
685
million
units
worldwide
almost
5
million
more
than

lawsuit

to

health
center
after

mother
colleen
brooks
who
died
of

the
hospital

commitment
was
nonbinding
and
refused
to
return
the
donation
on
january
24
2012
an
oklahoma
state
court
jury
in

found
in

ordering
