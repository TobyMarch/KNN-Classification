rhino
records
buffalo
springfield
are
one
of
the
archetype
rock
and
roll
bands
of
all
time
their
time
together
was
brief
but
in
just
over
two
years
they
managed
to
issue
three
albums
and
a
handful
of
singles
and
spawn
the
careers
of
stephen
stills
richie
furay
bruce
palmer
dewey
martin
jim
messina
and
neil
young
not
bad
for
a
bunch
of
longhaired
20somethings
just
starting
out
their
accomplishments
from
1966
to
1968
still
stand
tall
to
this
day
we’ve
tried
to
condense
their
genius
into
a
mere
ten
tracks
for
your
enjoyment
so
come
in
sit
down
and
dig
on
buffalo
springfield

'on
the
way
home'
from
'last
time
around'
(1968)
&nbsp
&nbsp
the
band's
final
lp
'last
time
around'
was
cobbled
together
from
sessions
recorded
just
prior
to
their
breakup
despite
the
unevenness
of
some
of
the
material
it
does
feature
a
handful
of
prizes
such
as
this
neil
young
composition
beautifully
sung
by
richie
furay
though
young
would
continue
to
perform
the
song
as
a
solo
artist
the
springfield
version
has
a
feel
all
its
own
it
captures
the
sound
of
late'60s
pop
wonderfully
the
addition
of
horns
and
strings
may
seem
against
the
tide
of
the
band's
style
but
in
retrospect
these
elements
work
perfectly
a
genuinely
splendid
record
hear
'on
the
way
home'

'sit
down
i
think
i
love
you'
from
'buffalo
springfield'
(1966)
&nbsp
&nbsp
a
stephen
stills
classic!
the
second
track
on
the
band's
debut
album
'sit
down''
is
pristine
folkrock
with
a
great
garage
band
feel
the
springfield
always
had
a
slightly
tougher
sound
than
say
the
byrds
and
it's
evident
here
the
song's
simple
but
highly
effective
harmonies
throughout
fit
like
a
glove
the
balance
between
the
clean
pretty
guitar
fills
and
the
dirtier
fuzz
solo
pairs
up
for
an
unbeatable
combination
the
song
was
covered
by
bay
area
rockers
the
mojo
men
who
employed
a
more
sophisticated
almost
beach
boyslike
pop
approach
and
took
the
song
into
the
top
40
in
1967
hear
'sit
down
i
think
i
love
you'
&nbsp

'out
of
my
mind'
from
'buffalo
springfield'
(1966)
&nbsp
&nbsp
a
sweetly
somber
moment
from
the
band's
1966
debut
lp
'out
of
my
mind'
features
a
beautiful
neil
young
melody
his
plaintive
reading
of
the
lyric
coupled
with
the
lush
background
vocals
are
enough
to
nudge
a
tear
out
of
the
old
eye
the
use
of
guitar
through
a
leslie
speaker
matched
up
with
a
fuzz
guitar
is
a
perfect
marriage
of
sounds
pure
beauty
all
the
way
hear
'out
of
my
mind'

'rock

roll
woman'
from
'buffalo
springfield
again'
(1967)
&nbsp
&nbsp
stephen
stills
certainly
wrote
some
great
songs
and
'rock
and
roll
woman'
ranks
right
up
with
his
best
you
can
hear
traces
of
the
road
he
would
follow
with
david
crosby
and
graham
nash
in
a
couple
years
time
at
the
roots
of
this
one
the
band
were
always
clever
enough
to
change
things
up
in
the
feel
of
a
song
by
altering
the
rhythm
or
adding
just
the
right
dynamics
to
take
it
away
from
simple
'folkrock'
terrain
some
tasty
guitar
work
adds
the
perfect
shading
here
hear
'rock

roll
woman'

'go
and
say
goodbye'
from
'buffalo
springfield'
(1966)
&nbsp
&nbsp
'go
and
say
goodbye'
is
a
real
countryinfluenced
stomper
and
one
of
that
first
album's
key
tracks
a
nice
change
up
by
having
the
lead
guitar
part
played
on
an
acoustic
this
time
around
the
guitar
interplay
flows
seamlessly
the
song
wants
to
become
a
fullon
raver
but
holds
itself
in
check
maintaining
a
sweet
frontporch
groove
for
all
of
its
two
and
a
half
minutes
gram
parsons
always
gets
the
nod
as
the
country/rock
pioneer
but
in
truth
it
was
as
much
or
more
about
stephen
stills
gene
clark
of
the
byrds
and
the
monkees'
mike
nesmith

'go
and

goodbye'

'flying
on
the
ground
is
wrong'
from
'buffalo
springfield'
(1966)
&nbsp
&nbsp
is
my
world
not
falling
down
i'm
in
pieces
on
the
ground
and
my
eyes
aren't
open
and
i'm
standing
on
my
knees
what
a
line
to
start
a
song!
certainly
one
of
neil
young's
finest
early
compositions
its
beauty
and
elegance
is
hard
to
top
beautifully
sung
by
richie
furay
he
pushes
forth
genuine
sincerity
from
the
lyric
and
captures
a
warmth
that
even
our
dear
neil's
voice
was
never
able
to
capture
in
solo
live
renditions
an
absolute
classic!
hear
'flying
on
the
ground
is
wrong'

'down
to
the
wire'
from
'buffalo
springfield
box'
(2001)
&nbsp
&nbsp
as
far
as
songs
that
missed
the
boat
the
first
time
around
this
has
got
to
rank
among
the
most
head
scratching
why
was
this
amazing
tune
left
on
the
shelves
during
the
springfield
days?
it
finally
saw
the
light
of
day
on
young's
'decade'
compilation
in
1977
that
version
featured
neil
himself
on
lead
vocals
but
with
the
release
of
the
buffalo
springfield
box
set
in
2001
we
finally
got
the
long
lost
take
of
the
song
with
stills
on
lead
vocal&nbsp
though
both
versions
are
fantastic
stills'
performance
has
a
sense
of
urgency
that
slightly
trumps
neil's
add
in
the
backwards
guitar
and
overall
production
and
it's
easily
one
of
their
finest
moments!
hear
'down
to
the
wire'

'bluebird'
from
'buffalo
springfield'
(1973)
&nbsp
&nbsp
'bluebird'
is
one
of
the
band's
definitive
songs
that
chiming
12string
acoustic
of
stills
runs
handinhand
with
the
biting
raunchy
guitar
of
young
for
a
match
made
in
heaven
the
song
is
pop
perfection
in
its
original
form
on
the
band's
second
album
but
just
for
the
hell
of
it
we've
chosen
the
rare
nineminute
version
that
has
been
outofprint
for
three
decades
there
are
actually
three
different
'bluebirds'
to
pick
from
the
original
album
version
which
winds
up
in
a
banjodriven
coda
the
original
single
edit
which
fades
out
early
and
this
long
jam
take
that
only
appeared
on
a
1973
compilation
lp
simply
titled
'buffalo
springfield'
it's
kind
of
been
forgotten
over
the
years
in
no
small
part
due
to
being
unavailable
so
we
include
it
here
to
rescue
it
from
the
cutout
bins
of
time
any
way
you
slice
it
it's
a
great
song!

'mr
soul'
from
'buffalo
springfield
again'
(1967)
&nbsp
&nbsp
one
of
neil
young's
signature
songs
'mr
soul'
is
fullon
rock
and
roll
for
the
ages
with
its
'satisfaction'styled
guitar
riff
young
mixes
in
beautifully
oblique
lyrics
covered
with
attitude
to
make
one
of
the
springfield
best
records
the
maximum
fuzz
lead
break

with
its
echoes
of
otis
redding's
'i
can't
turn
you
loose'

still
stands
as
definitive
neil
the
song
was
issued
as
a
single
as
well
as
opening
up
the
band's
sophomore
offering
'buffalo
springfield
again'
it
has
remained
a
staple
of
young's
live
shows
ever
since
and
was
recently
played
on
his
2012
us
tour

'for
what
it's
worth'
from
'buffalo
springfield'
(1966)
&nbsp
&nbsp
when
it
comes
to
buffalo
springfield
if
there
is
one
song
that
is
familiar
to
everyone
it's
this
one!
'for
what
it's
worth'
exemplifies
the
usvsthem
take
off
your
blinders
lyrics
of
the
era
it's
been
used
abused
and
drowned
in
airplay
over
its
46
years
but
it
refuses
to
die!
and
for
good
reason
its
sound
is
utterly
unique
from
the
unassuming
bassdrumandguitarharmonics
intro
through
the
rousing
singalong
chorus
it
has
become
an
american
classic
written
in
part
in
reaction
to
the
'riots
on
sunset
strip'
happening
in
mid1966
where
young
people
were
coming
to
blows
with
the
authorities
it
caught
the
imagination
of
stephen
stills
and
he
turned
it
into
pure
poetry
neil
young's
subtle
guitar
breaks
color
the
song
with
a
tension
that
matches
the
lyric
recorded
as
a
single
after
their
debut
album
had
hit
store
shelves
it
was
added
to
later
pressings
and
has
remained
the
band's
signature
song
for
over
45
years
hear
'for
what
it's
worth'
