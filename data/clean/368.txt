every

epiphany
while
riding
his
bicycle
he
heard
elvis

the
class
drawing
guitars
in
his
schoolbooks

harrison
at
a
press
conference
in
the

in
1964
in
march
1958
harrison
auditioned
for
the
quarrymen
at
rory
storm's
morgue
skiffle
club
playing
guitar
boogie
shuffle
but
lennon
felt
that
harrison
then
14
was
too
young
to
join
the
band[18]
during
a
second
meeting
arranged
by
mccartney
he
performed
the
lead
guitar
part
for
the
instrumental
raunchy
on
the
upper
deck
of
a
liverpool
bus[19]
soon
afterwards
he
began
socializing
with
the
group
filling
in
on
guitar
as
needed[20]
and
by
the
time
he
turned
15
they
had
accepted
him
as
a
member[21]
although
his
father
wanted
him
to
continue
his
education
harrison
left
school
at
16
and
worked
for
several
months
as
an

arranged
for
the
band
now
calling
themselves
the
beatles
to
play
at
the
kaiserkeller
club
in
hamburg
owned
by
bruno
koschmider[23]
the
impromptu
musical
education
harrison
received
while
playing
long
hours
with
the
beatles
as
well
as
the
guitar
lessons
he
took
from
tony
sheridan
while
they
briefly
served
as
his
backing
group
laid
the
foundations
of
his
sound
and
of
his
quiet
professional
role
within
the
group
he
was
later
known
as
the
quiet
beatle[24]
the
band's
first
residency
in
hamburg
ended
prematurely
when
harrison
was
deported
for
being
too
young
to
work
in
nightclubs[25]
when
brian
epstein
became
their
manager
in
december
1961
he
polished
their
image

secured
them
a
recording
contract
with

harrison
had
begun
to
lead

into

through
his

and
towards

through

he
later
called

his
favourite
[beatles]
album[31]
revolver
(1966)
included
three
of
his
compositions
taxman
love
you
to
and
i
want
to
tell
you[32]
his
introduction
of
the
dronelike
tambura
part
on
lennon's
tomorrow
never
knows
exemplified
the
band's
ongoing
exploration
of
nonwestern
instruments[33]
the
tabladriven
love
you
to
was
the
beatles'
first
genuine
foray
into
indian
music[34]
according
to
the
ethnomusicologist
david
reck
the
song
set
a
precedent
in
popular
music
as
an
example
of
asian
culture
being
represented
by
westerners
respectfully
and
without
parody[35]
harrison
continued
to
develop
his
interest
in
nonwestern
instrumentation
playing
swarmandal
on
strawberry
fields
forever[36]
by
late
1966
harrison's
interests
had
moved
away
from
the
beatles
as
reflected
in
his
choice
of
eastern
gurus
and
religious
leaders
for
inclusion
on
the
album
cover
for
sgt
pepper's
lonely
hearts
club
band
in
1967[37][nb
3]
his
sole
composition
on
the
album
was
the
indianinspired
within
you
without
you
to
which
no
other
beatle
contributed[39]
he
played
sitar
and
tambura
on
the
track
backed
by
musicians
from
the
london
asian
music
circle
on
dilruba
swarmandal
and
tabla[40][nb

in
1968
his
song
the
inner
light
was
recorded
at
the
emi
studios
in
bombay
featuring
a
group
of
local
musicians
playing
traditional
indian
instruments[42]
released
as
the
bside
to
mccartney's
lady
madonna
it
was
the
first
harrison
composition
to
appear
on
a
beatles
single[42]
derived
from
a
quotation
from
the
tao
te
ching
the
song's
lyric
reflected
harrison's
deepening
interest
in
hinduism
and
meditation
while
musically
it
embraced
the
karnatak
discipline
of
indian
music
rather
than
the
hindustani
style
of
his
previous
work
in
the
genre[43]
dylan
and
the
band
were
a
major
musical
influence
on
harrison
at
the
end
of
his
career
with
the
beatles[44]
he
established
a
friendship
with
dylan
and
found
himself
drawn
to
the
band's
sense
of
communal
musicmaking
and
to
the
creative
equality
among
the
band
members
in
contrast
with
lennon
and
mccartney's
domination
of
the
beatles'
songwriting
and
creative
direction
this
coincided
with
a
prolific
period
in
his
songwriting
and
his
growing
desire
to
assert
his
independence
from
the
band[45]
during
the
recording
of
the
beatles
in
1968
tensions
ran
high
and
drummer
ringo
starr
quit
briefly[46]
harrison's
songwriting
contributions
to
the
album
included

featured
eric

on

piggies
long
long

tensions
among
the
beatles
surfaced
again
during
the
filming
of
rehearsals
at
twickenham
studios
in
january
1969
for
what
became
the
album
let
it
be[45]
frustrated
by
the
poor
working
conditions
in
the
cold
and
sterile
film
studio
as
well
as
by
what
he
perceived
as
lennon's
creative
disengagement
from
the
beatles
and
a
domineering
attitude
from
mccartney
harrison
quit
the
group
on
10
january
but
agreed
to
return
twelve
days
later[48]
relations
among
the
beatles
were
more
cordial
though
still
strained
during
sessions
for
their
final
recorded
album
abbey
road[49]
the
lp
included
two
of
harrison's
most
respected
beatles
compositions
here
comes
the
sun
and
something
which
became
one
half
of
the
beatles'
first
doublesided

harrison's
first
aside
and
his
first
chart
topper[50]
in
1969
frank
sinatra
recorded
something
and
later
dubbed
it
the
greatest
love
song
of
the
past
fifty
years[51]
lennon
considered
it
the
best
song
on
abbey
road
and
it
became
the
beatles'
second
most
covered
song
after
yesterday[52]
author
peter
lavezzoli
wrote
harrison
would
finally
achieve
equal
songwriting
status&nbsp…
with
his
two
classic
contributions
to
the
final
beatles'
lp[53]
in
april
1970
when
harrison's
for
you
blue
was
released
in
america
as
a
double
aside
with
mccartney's
the
long
and
winding
road
it
became
the
band's
second
charttopping
double
aside
and
for
you
blue
became
harrison's
second
number
one
hit[54]
his
increased
productivity
and
the
beatles'
reluctance
to
include
his
songs
on
their
albums
meant
that
by
the
time
of
their
breakup
he
had
amassed
a
stockpile
of
unreleased
compositions[55]
while
harrison
grew
as
a
songwriter
his
compositional
presence
on
beatles
albums
remained
limited
to
two
or
three
songs
increasing
his
frustration
and
significantly
contributing
to
the
band's
breakup[56]
harrison's
last
recording
session
with
the
beatles
was
on
4
january
1970
when

denied

reflected
on

work
it's
just
something
that
was
like
my
continuation
from
the

really
it
was
me
sort
of
getting
out
of
the
beatles
and
just
going
my
own
way&nbsp
it
was
a
very
happy
occasion[77]
he
commented
on
the
production
well
in
those
days
it
was
like
the
reverb
was
kind
of
used
a
bit
more
than
what
i
would
do
now
in

i
don't
use
reverb
at
all
i
can't
stand
it&nbsp
you
know
it's
hard
to
go
back
to
anything
thirty

later

expect
it
to
be
how
you
would
want
it
now[78]
the

the

responding

from
ravi
shankar
harrison
organized
a
charity
event
the
concert
for
bangladesh
which
took
place
on
1
august
1971
drawing
over
40000
people
to
two
shows
in
new
york's
madison
square
garden[79]
the
goal
of
the
event
was
to
raise
money
to
aid
starving
refugees
during
the
bangladesh
liberation
war[80]
shankar
opened
the
show
which
featured
popular
musicians
such
as
dylan

leon

badfinger
preston
and

a

film
in

tax
troubles
and
questionable
expenses
later
tied
up
many
of
the
proceeds
but
harrison
commented
mainly
the
concert
was
to
attract
attention
to
the
situation&nbsp
the
money
we
raised
was
secondary
and
although
we
had
some
money
problems&nbsp
they
still
got
plenty&nbsp
even
though
it
was
a
drop
in
the
ocean
the
main
thing
was
we
spread
the
word
and
helped
get
the
war
ended[81]
the
event
has
been
described
as
an
innovative
precursor
for

largescale
charity

the

was
lavishly

its
dominant
message
was
harrison's
hindu
beliefs[85]
in

other
reviewers
were
less
enthusiastic
describing
the

as
awkward
sanctimonious
and
overly
sentimental
a
reaction
that
left
harrison
despondent[88]
in

the
tour
also
included
traditional

contemporary
indian
music
performed
by

despite
numerous
positive
reviews
the
consensus
reaction
to
the
tour
was
negative
with
complaints
about
the
content
structure
and
length
the
show's
duration
of
two
and
a
half
hours
was
seen
as
excessive
at
the
time[91]
some
fans
found
shankar's
significant
presence
a
bizarre
disappointment
having
expected
to
see
only
harrison
perform
and
many
were
affronted
by
what
inglis
described
as
harrison's
sermonizing[92]
further
he
reworked
the
lyrics
to
several
beatles
songs
and
some
of
the
substitutions
were
seen
as
gratuitously
offensive[92]
his
laryngitisaffected
vocals
also
disappointed
fans
and
critics
who
began
calling
the
tour
dark
hoarse[93]
harrison
was
so
deeply
bothered
by
the
caustic
backlash
that
he
did
not
tour
again
until
the
1990s[92]
the
author
robert
rodriguez
commented
while
the
dark
horse
tour
might
be
considered
a
noble
failure
there
were
a
number
of
fans
who
were
tunedin
to
what
was
being
attempted
they
went
away
ecstatic
conscious
that
they
had
just
witnessed
something
so
uplifting
that
it
could
never
be
repeated[94]

the

in

the
death
of
his
father

in

during

harrison's

did
not

respect
from

author

claimed
that
harrison
had
created
a
new
form
calling
the
composition
a
quintessential
fusion
of
pop
and
indian
music[185]
lennon
called
the

one
of
harrison's
best
his
mind
and
his
music
are
clear
there
is
his
innate
talent
he
brought
that
sound
together[186]
beatles
biographer
bob
spitz
described
something
as
a
masterpiece
an
intensely
stirring
romantic
ballad
that
would
challenge
'yesterday'
and
'michelle'
as
one
of
the
most
recognizable
songs
they
ever
produced[187]
according
to
kenneth
womack
'harrison
comes
into
his
own
on
abbey
road&nbsp
here
comes
the
sun
is
matched—indeed
surpassed—only
by
something
his
crowning
achievement'[188]
inglis
considered
abbey
road
a
turning
point
in
harrison's
development
as
a
songwriter
and
musician
he
described
harrison's
contributions
to
the
lp
as
exquisite
declaring
them
equal
to
any
previous
beatles
songs
during
the
album's
recording
harrison
asserted
more
creative
control
than
before
proactively
rejecting
suggestions
for
changes
to
his
music
or
lyrics
particularly
from
mccartney[189]
his
interest
in
indian
music
proved
a
strong
influence
on
his
songwriting
and
contributed
to
his
innovation
within
the
beatles
according
to
rolling
stone
harrison's
openness
to
new
sounds
and
textures
cleared
new
paths
for
his
rock
and
roll
compositions
his
use
of
dissonance
on&nbsp
'taxman'
and
'i
want
to
tell
you'
was
revolutionary
in
popular
music
–
and
perhaps
more
originally
creative
than
the
avantgarde
mannerisms
that
lennon
and
mccartney
borrowed
from
the
music
of
karlheinz
stockhausen
luciano
berio
edgard
var&egravese
and
igor
stravinsky[190]
in
1997
author
gerry
farrell
commented
it
is
a
mark
of
harrison's
sincere
involvement&nbsp
that
nearly
thirty
years
on
the
beatles'
'indian'
songs
remain
the
most
imaginative
and
successful
examples
of
this
type
of
fusion[191]
guitar
work
[edit]
he
was
clearly
an
innovator
george
to
me
was
taking
certain
elements
of
rb
and
rock
and
rockabilly
and
creating
something
unique[192]
—eric
clapton
rolling
stone
founder
jann
wenner
described
harrison
as
a
guitarist
who
was
never
showy
but
who
had
an
innate
eloquent
melodic
sense
he
played
exquisitely
in
the
service
of
the
song[193]
harrison's
friend
and
former
bandmate
tom
petty
agreed
he
just
had
a
way
of
getting
right
to
the
business
of
finding
the
right
thing
to
play[194]
the
guitar
picking
style
of
chet
atkins
and
carl
perkins
influenced
harrison
giving
a
country
music
feel
to
many
of
the
beatles'
recordings[195]
he
identified
chuck
berry
as
an
early
influence
and
ry
cooder
as
an
important
later
influence[196]
in
1961
the
beatles
recorded
cry
for
a
shadow
a
bluesinspired
instrumental
cowritten
by
lennon
and
harrison
who
is
credited
with
composing
the
song's
lead
guitar
part
building
on
unusual
chord
voicings
and
imitating
the
style
of
other
english
groups
such
as
the
shadows[197]
the
musicologist
walter
everett
noted
that
while
early
beatles
compositions
typically
held
close
to
the
conventional
patterns
in
rock
music
at
the
time
he
also
identified
significant
variations
in
their
rhythm
and
tonal
direction[198]
harrison's
liberal
use
of
the
diatonic
scale
in
his
guitar
playing
reveals
the
influence
of
buddy
holly
and
his
interest
in
berry
inspired
him
to
compose
songs
based
on
the
blues
scale
while
incorporating
a
rockabilly
feel
in
the
style
of
perkins[199]
within
this
framework
he
often
utilized
syncopation
as
during
his
guitar
solos
for
the
beatles'
covers
of
berry's
roll
over
beethoven
and
too
much
monkey
business[200]
another
of
harrison's
musical
techniques
was
the
use
of
guitar
lines
written
in
octaves
as
on
i'll
be
on
my
way[201]
he
was
the
first
person
to
own
a
rickenbacker
360/12
a
guitar
that
featured
twelve
strings
in
6
pairs
the
low
eight
of
which
are
tuned
in
pairs
one
octave
apart
the
higher
4
being
pairs
tuned
in
unison
the
rickenbacker
is
unique
among
twelve
string
guitars
in
having
the
lower
octave
string
of
each
of
the
first
four
pairs
placed
above
the
higher
tuned
string
this
and
the
naturally
rich
harmonics
produced
by
a
twelve
string
guitar
providing
the
distinctive
overtones
found
on
many
of
the
beatles
recordings[201]
his
use
of
this
guitar
during
the
recording
of
a
hard
day's
night
helped
to
popularize
the
model
and
the
jangly
sound
became
so
prominent
that
melody
maker
termed
it
the
beatles'
secret
weapon[202][nb
17]
harrison
wrote
the
chord
progression
of
his
first
published
song
don't
bother
me
(1963)
almost
exclusively
in
the
dorian
mode
demonstrating
an
interest
in
exotic
tones
that
eventually
culminated
in
his
embrace
of
indian
music
the
dark
timbre
of
his
guitar
playing
on
the
track
was
accentuated
by
his
use
of
uncomplicated
yet
effective
c+9
chord
voicings
and
a
solo
in
the
minor
pentatonic
scale[204]
by
1964
he
had
begun
to
develop
a
distinctive
personal
style
as
a
guitarist
writing
parts
that
featured
the
use
of
nonresolving
tones
as
with
the
ending
chord
arpeggios
on
a
hard
day's
night[199]
in
1965
he
used
an
expression
pedal
to
control
his
guitar's
volume
on
i
need
you
creating
a
syncopated
flautando
effect
with
the
melody
resolving
its
dissonance
through
tonal
displacements[205]
he
used
the
same
volumeswell
technique
on
yes
it
is
applying
what
everett
described
as
ghostly
articulation
to
the
song's
natural
harmonics[199]
of
rubber
soul's
if
i
needed
someone
harrison
said
it's
like
a
million
other
songs
written
around
the
d
chord
if
you
move
your
fingers
about
you
get
various
little
melodies&nbsp
it
amazes
me
that
people
still
find
new
permutations
of
the
same
notes[206]
his
other
contribution
to
the
album
think
for
yourself
features
what
everett
described
as
ambiguous
tonal
coloring
utilizing
chromaticism
in
g
major
with
a
strange
mixture
of
the
dorian
mode
and
the
minor
pentatonic
he
called
it
a
tour
de
force
of
altered
scale

in

for

as
the
best
song
musically
and
lyrically
of

after
delaney
bramlett
inspired
him
to
learn
slide
guitar
harrison
began
to
incorporate
it
into
his
solo
work
which
allowed
him
to
mimic
many
traditional
indian
instruments
including
the
sarangi
and
the
dilruba[216]
leng
described
harrison's
slide

on

as
a
departure
for
the

a
hawaiian
influence
is
notable
in
much
of
harrison's
music
ranging
from
his
slide
guitar
work
on
gone

(1982)
to
his
televised
performance
of
the
cab
calloway
standard
between
the

and
the
deep
blue
sea
on
ukulele
in
1992[218]
lavezzoli
described
harrison's
slide
playing
on
the
grammywinning
instrumental
marwa
blues
(2002)
as
demonstrating
hawaiian
influences
while
comparing
the
melody
to
an
indian
sarod
or
veena
calling
it
yet
another
demonstration
of
harrison's
unique
slide
approach[219]
harrison
was
an
admirer
of
george
formby
and
a
member
of
the
ukulele
society
of
great

ravi

in
2009
during
the
beatles'
american
tour
in
august
1965
harrison's
friend
david
crosby
of
the
byrds
introduced
him
to
indian
classical
music
and
the
work
of
sitar
maestro
ravi
shankar[261][262]
harrison
described
shankar
as
the
first
person
who
ever
impressed
me
in
my
life&nbsp
and
he
was
the
only
person
who
didn't
try
to
impress
me[263]
harrison
became
fascinated
with
the
sitar
and
immersed
himself
in
indian
music[264]
according
to
lavezzoli
harrison's
introduction
of
the
instrument
on
the
beatles'
song
norwegian
wood
opened
the
floodgates
for
indian
instrumentation
in
rock
music
triggering
what
shankar
would
call
'the
great
sitar
explosion'
of
1966–67[265]
lavezzoli
described
harrison
as
the
man
most
responsible
for
this
phenomenon[266][nb
19]
in
june
1966
harrison
met
shankar
at
the
home
of
mrs
angadi
of
the
asian
music
circle
asked
to
be
his
student
and
was
accepted[268]
on
6
july
harrison
travelled
to
india
to
buy
a
sitar
from
rikhi
ram

sons
in
new
delhi[268]
lavezzoli
described
harrison's
sitar
playing
on
the
revolver
track
love
you
to
as
an
astonishing
improvement
over
norwegian
wood
and
the
most
accomplished
performance
on
sitar
by
any
rock
musician[269]
in
september
he
returned
to
india
to
study
sitar
with
shankar[268]
he
initially
stayed
in
bombay
then
moved
to
a
houseboat
on
a
remote
lake
where
shankar
taught
him
for
six
weeks[268]
after
shankar
he
received
tutelage
from
shambhu
das[270]
harrison
studied
the
instrument
until
1968
when
an
encounter
with
clapton
and
hendrix
at
a
hotel
in
new
york
convinced
him
to
put
down
the
instrument
and
return
to
guitar
playing
he
commented
i
decided&nbsp
i
should
get
back
to
the
guitar
because
i'm
not
getting
any
better
at
it
and
i'm
not
going
to
be
a
great
sitar
player&nbsp
because
i
should
have
started
at
least
fifteen
years
earlier[271]

samādhi
in

india
1996
by
the
mid1960s
harrison
had
become
an
admirer
of
indian
culture
and
mysticism
introducing
it
to
the
other
beatles[272]
during
the
filming
of
help!
in
the
bahamas
they
met
the
founder
of
sivananda
yoga
swami
vishnudevananda
who
gave
each
of
them
a
signed
copy
of
his
book
the
complete
illustrated
book
of
yoga[273]
between
the
end
of
the
last
beatles
tour
in
1966
and
the
beginning
of
the
sgt
pepper
recording
sessions
he
made
a
pilgrimage
to
bombay
with
his
wife
pattie
where
he
studied
sitar
met
several
gurus
and
visited
various
holy
places[274]
in
1968
he
travelled
to
rishikesh
in
northern
india
with
the
other
beatles
to
study
meditation
with
maharishi
mahesh
yogi[274]
harrison's
use
of
psychedelic
drugs
encouraged
his
path
to
meditation
and
hinduism
he
commented
for
me
it
was
like
a
flash
the
first
time
i
had
acid
it
just
opened
up
something
in
my
head
that
was
inside
of
me
and
i
realized
a
lot
of
things
i
didn't
learn
them
because
i
already
knew
them
but
that
happened
to
be
the
key
that
opened
the
door
to
reveal
them
from
the
moment
i
had
that
i
wanted
to
have
it
all
the
time—these
thoughts
about
the
yogis
and
the
himalayas
and
ravi's
music[108]
harrison
became
a
vegetarian
in
the
late
1960s
and
a
devotee
of
the
indian
mystic
paramahansa
yogananda[275]
in
mid1969
he
produced
the
single
hare
krishna
mantra
performed
by
members
of
the
london
radha
krishna
temple
soon
after
harrison
embraced
the
hare
krishna
tradition
particularly
japayoga
chanting
with
beads
and
became
a
lifelong
devotee[276][nb
20]
he
respected
people
of
other
faiths
and
once
remarked
all
religions
are
branches
of
one
big
tree
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
call
him
just
as
long
as
you
call[278]
he
commented
on
his
beliefs
krishna
actually
was
in
a
body
as
a
person&nbsp
what
makes
it
complicated
is
if
he's
god
what's
he
doing
fighting
on
a
battlefield?
it
took
me
ages
to
try
to
figure
that
out
and
again
it
was
yogananda's
spiritual
interpretation
of
the
bhagavad
gita
that
made
me
realise
what
it
was
our
idea
of
krishna
and
arjuna
on
the
battlefield
in
the
chariot
so
this
is
the
point—that
we're
in
these
bodies
which
is
like
a
kind
of
chariot
and
we're
going
through
this
incarnation
this
life
which
is
kind
of
a
battlefield
the
senses
of
the
body&nbsp
are
the
horses
pulling
the
chariot
and
we
have
to
get
control
over
the
chariot
by
getting
control
over
the
reins
and
arjuna
in
the
end
says
'please
krishna
you
drive
the
chariot'
because
unless
we
bring
christ
or
krishna
or
buddha
or
whichever
of
our
spiritual
guides&nbsp
we're
going
to
crash
our
chariot
and
we're
going
to
turn
over
and
we're
going
to
get
killed
in
the
battlefield
that's
why
we
say
'hare
krishna
hare
krishna'
asking
krishna
to
come
and
take
over
the
chariot[279]
before
his
religious
conversion
the
only
british
performer
known
for
similar
activities
had
been
cliff
richard
whose
conversion
to
christianity
in
1966
had
gone
largely
unnoticed
by
the
public
by
contrast
wrote
inglis
harrison's
spiritual
journey
was
seen
as
a
serious
and
important
development
that
reflected
popular
music's
increasing
maturity&nbsp
what
he
and
the
beatles
had
managed
to
overturn
was
the
paternalistic
assumption
that
popular
musicians
had
no
role
other
than
to
stand
on
stage
and
sing
their
hit
songs[280]
family
and
interests
[edit]

married
the
model
pattie
boyd
on
21
january
1966
with
mccartney
as
best
man[281]
harrison
and
boyd
had
met
in
1964
during
the
production
of
the
film
a
hard
day's
night
in
which
the
19yearold
boyd
had
been
cast
as
a
schoolgirl[282]
they
separated
in
1974
and
their
divorce
was
finalized
in
1977[283]
boyd
said
her
decision
to
end
their
marriage
and
leave
harrison
was
due
largely
to
his
repeated
infidelities
culminating
in
an
affair
with
starr's
wife
maureen
which
boyd
called
the
final
straw[284]
she
characterized
the
last
year
of
their
marriage
as
fuelled
by
alcohol
and
cocaine
and
she
stated
george
used
coke
excessively
and
i
think
it
changed
him&nbsp
it
froze
his
emotions
and
hardened
his
heart[285]
she
subsequently
moved
in
with
clapton
and
they
married
in
1979[286][nb

harrison

had
met
at

born

he
restored
the
english
manor
house

park
his
home
in
henleyonthames
where
several
of
his
music
videos
were

crackerbox
palace
the
grounds
also
served
as
the
background
for
the
cover
of
all
things
must
pass[289][nb
22]
he
employed
ten
workers
to
maintain
the
36acre
(150000&nbspm2)
garden[292]
harrison
commented
on
gardening
as
a
form
of
escapism
sometimes
i
feel
like
i'm
actually
on
the
wrong
planet
and
it's
great
when
i'm
in
my
garden
but
the
minute
i
go
out
the
gate
i
think
'what
the
hell
am
i
doing
here?'[293]
his
autobiography
i
me
mine
is
dedicated
to
gardeners
everywhere[294]
the
former
beatles
publicist
derek
taylor
helped
harrison
write
the
book
which
said
little
about
the
beatles
focusing
instead
on
harrison's
hobbies
music
and
lyrics[295]
taylor
commented
george
is
not
disowning
the
beatles&nbsp
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
actually
a
short
part
of
his
life[296]
harrison
had
an
interest
in
sports
cars
and
motor
racing
he
was
one
of
the
100
people
who
purchased
the
mclaren
f1

car[297]
he
had
collected
photos
of
racing
drivers
and
their
cars
since
he
was
young
at

he
had
attended
his
first
race
the
1955
british

relationships
with
the
other
beatles
[edit]
for
most
of
the
beatles'
career
the
relationships
in
the
group
were
close
according
to
hunter
davies
the
beatles
spent
their
lives
not
living
a
communal
life
but
communally
living
the
same
life
they
were
each
other's
greatest
friends
harrison's
exwife
pattie
boyd
described
how
the
beatles
all
belonged
to
each
other
and
admitted
george
has
a
lot
with
the
others
that
i
can
never
know
about
nobody
not
even
the
wives
can
break
through
or
even
comprehend
it[301]
starr
said
we
really
looked
out
for
each
other
and
we
had
so
many
laughs
together
in
the
old
days
we'd
have
the
biggest
hotel
suites
the
whole
floor
of
the
hotel
and
the
four
of
us
would
end
up
in
the
bathroom
just
to
be
with
each
other
he
added
there
were
some
really
loving
caring
moments
between
four
people
a
hotel
room
here
and
there
–
a
really
amazing
closeness
just
four
guys
who
loved
each
other
it
was
pretty
sensational[302]
lennon
stated
that
his
relationship
with
harrison
was
one
of
young
follower
and
older
guy&nbsp
[he]
was
like
a
disciple
of
mine
when
we
started[303]
the
two
later
bonded
over
their
lsd
experiences
finding
common
ground
as
seekers
of
spirituality
they
took
radically
different
paths
thereafter
harrison
finding
god
and
lennon
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
people
are
the
creators
of
their
own
lives[304]
in
1974
harrison
said
of
his
former
bandmate
john
lennon
is
a
saint
and
he's
heavyduty
and
he's
great
and
i
love
him
but
at
the
same
time
he's
such
a
bastard
–
but
that's
the
great
thing
about
him
you
see?[305]
harrison
and
mccartney
were
the
first
of
the
beatles
to
meet
having
shared
a
school
bus
and
often
learned
and
rehearsed
new
guitar
chords
together[306]
mccartney
stated
that
he
and
harrison
usually
shared
a
bedroom
while
touring[307]
mccartney
was
best
man
at
harrison's
wedding
in
1966
and
was
the
only
beatle
in
attendance[308]
mccartney
has
referred
to
harrison
as
his
baby
brother[309]
in
a
1974
bbc
radio
interview
with
alan
freeman
harrison
stated
[mccartney]
ruined
me
as
a
guitar
player[310]
perhaps
the
most
significant
obstacle
to
a
beatles
reunion
after
the
death
of
lennon
was
harrison
and
mccartney's
personal
relationship
as
both
men
admitted
that
they
often
got
on
each
other's
nerves[311]
rodriguez
commented
even
to
the
end
of
george's
days
theirs
was
a
volatile
relationship[312]
humanitarian
work
[edit]
harrison
was
involved
in
humanitarian
and
political
activism
throughout
his
life
in
the
1960s
the
beatles
supported
the
civil
rights
movement
and
protested
against
the
vietnam
war
after
the
band's
breakup
