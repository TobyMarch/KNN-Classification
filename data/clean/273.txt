they
caught
the
attention
of
record
executive
derek
shulman
who
signed
them
to
mercury
records
and
who
was
part
of
the
polygram
company
because
jon
bon
jovi
wanted
a
group
name
pamela
maher
a
friend
of
richard
fischer
and
an
employee
of
doc
mcghee
suggested
they
call
themselves
bon
jovi
following
the
example
of
the
other
famous
twoword
bands
such
as
van
halen
this
name
was
chosen
instead
of
the
original
idea
of
johnny
electric
pamela's
suggestion
of
the
name
was
met
with
little
enthusiasm

tour
bon

had
16
months
of
concerts
under

and
the

members
were
exhausted
physically
mentally
and
emotionally
finally
following
the
last
tour
date
in
mexico
and
without
any
clear
plans
for
their
future
the
band
members
just
went
home
between

the

went
their
separate
ways
the
exhaustion
of
recording
both
slippery

back
to
back
with
highly
paced
world
tours
after
each
album
took
its
toll
on
the
band
the
band
has
since
stated
that
there
were
few
if
any
goodbyes
between
them
at
the
end
of
the
new
jersey
tour
during
the
time
they
took
off
from
the
scene
the
band
retreated
to
their
own
projects
and
showed
no
desire
for
making
another
album
disillusioned
with
the
music
business
despite
all
his
success
and
unhappy
with
the
status
quo
in
1991
jon
bon
jovi
fired
his
management
business
advisers
and
agents
including
his
longtime
manager
doc

took
on
the
quarterbacking
responsibilities
himself
by
closing
ranks
and
creating
bon

management
in
october
1991
the
band
went
to
a
caribbean
island
of
st
thomas
to
discuss
plans
for
the
future
they
managed
to
resolve
their
differences
by
allowing
each
member
to
speak
about
his
feelings
without
interruption
from
each
other[citation

upon
resolving
their
issues
they
headed
back
into
the
vancouver
little
mountain
studios
with
bob

to
work
on
the
band's
fifth
album
in

(19921995)
[edit]
bon
jovi's
fifth
studio
album
keep
the
faith
was
released
in
november
1992
representing
the
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
in
the
history
of
bon
jovi
and
marking
a
change
in
the
band's
sound
and
image
the
album
turned
away
from
heavy
drums
and
wild
guitar
solos
but
instead
introduced
a
more
mature
sound
of
bon
jovi
and
contained
more
serious
lyrics
the
media
focused
considerable
attention
on
jon
bon
jovi’s
hair
when
jon
bon
jovi
cut
his
hair
he
made
headlines
on
cnn
to
promote
keep
the
faith
they
returned
to
their
roots
playing
a
few
dates
at
the
small
new
jersey
clubs
where
they
had
started
their
career
the
band
appeared
on
mtv
unplugged
but
that
was
different
from
the
other
episodes
of
mtv
unplugged
series
the
performance
captures
bon
jovi
in

musical
style
[edit]
bon
jovi's
musical
style
has
generally
been
characterized
as
'hard
rock'
'pop/hair
metal'
'arena
rock'
and
'pop
rock'
although
they
have
also
experimented
and
varied
from
these
genres
at
times[47]
the
band's
first
four
albums
blended
the
pop
metal
and
hard
rock
genres
although
they
had
mostly
shed
the
pop
metal
sound
by
their
fifth
studio
album
keep
the
faith
and
their
sixth
these
days
utilizing
a
more
mature
hard
rock
sound
crush
was
characterized
as
far
enough
into
pop/rock
to
actually
stand
a
chance
of
getting
airplay
while
bounce
was
described
as
heavy
serious
rock
have
a
nice
day
was
also
characterized
as
being
heavier
than
crush[48]
the
band
altered
their
sound
dramatically
in
their
next
release
lost
highway
blending
influences
from
country
music
and
country
rock
a
sound
jon
bon
jovi
described
as
a
bon
jovi
album
influenced
by
nashville
bon
jovi
returned
to
a
more
typical
rock
sound
on
the
circle
which
was
described
by
allmusic
as
conjured
by
echoed
delayed
guitars
shimmering
keyboards
and
spacious
rhythms[49]
some
of
the
band's
influences
are
bruce
springsteen
the
rolling
stones
aerosmith
van

the
