two
top
10
singles—take

easy

witchy
woman—with
their
first
album

eagles
then
became
one
of
the
most
popular
bands
of
the
1970s
their
next
three
albums—desperado
on
the
border
and
one
of
these
nights—were
all
huge
hits
henley
went
on
to
a
huge
solo
career
after
the
eagles
broke
up
with
singles
such
as
“dirty
laundry”

don
henley
early
life
singer
songwriter
musician
and
activist
don
henley
was
born
on
july
22
1947
in
gilmer
texas
he
was
raised
in
linden—a
small
dusty
town
near
the
arkansas
and
louisiana
border
with
a
population
of
only
2400
his
father
cj
henley
was
a
world
war
ii
veteran
who
owned
an
auto
parts
store
and
his
mother
hughlene
mcwhorter
was
a
teacher
henley
was
exposed
to
music
from
a
very
young
age
i
had
piano
lessons
when
i
was
kid
he
recalls
my
father
loved
music
my
mother
loved
music
they
always
had
records
on
in
the
house
growing
up
in
texas
in
the
1950s
henley
was
exposed
to
a
diverse
and
eclectic
mix
of
musical
genres
all
the
world
war
ii
and
postwar
big
band
stuff
there
was
an
old
black
lady
who
worked
for
my
grandfather
who
was
always
singing
spirituals
what
they
called
'negro
spirituals'
back
then
my
grandmother
was
always
singing
hymns
my
father
also
listened
to
country
music
on
the
radio
despite
this
wide
exposure
to
music
as
a
child
henley's
decision
to
pursue
music
seriously
came
largely
as
an
accident
as
a
high
school
student
having
long
since
given
up
on
his
piano
lessons
henley
tried
out
for
the
football
team
after
a
brief
and
disastrous
stint
on
the
football
field
henley
instead
joined
the
marching
band
under
the
encouragement
of
childhood
friend
richard
bowden
whose
father
had
a
dixieland
band
henley
proved
a
natural
at
the
drums
i
was
always
beating
out
a
rhythm
on
my
schoolbooks
and
on
the
dashboard
of
the
car
he
recalls
it
used
to
drive
people
nuts
but
the
drums
sort
of
came
naturally
to
me
in
1962
at
the
age
of
15
henley
earned
a
spot
in
his
friend
richard's
band
playing
mostly
dixieland
and
rock
'n'
roll
instrumentals
musical
influences
like
so
many
other
people
around
the
world
henley
found
his
musical
tastes
entirely
transformed
by
the
emergence
of
the
beatles
in
the
1960s
the
beatles
were
the
soundtrack
to
my
life
he
recalls
when
the
beatles
came
along
life
changed
the
planets
all
shifted
somehow—that's
when
i
became
very
serious
about
doing
music
as
a
profession
before
it
had
just
been
for
a
laugh
henley's
band
(initially
named
the
four
speeds
and
later
renamed
felicity
and
then
shiloh)
chose
him
as
its
lead
singer
he
was
also
the
band's
primary
songwriter
and
one
of
his
compositions—a
tune
called
hurtin'—was
even
produced
and
recorded
by
a
local
record
company
henley
graduated
from
high
school
in
1965
and
enrolled
at
nearby
stephen
f
austin
university
a
year
later
he
transferred
to
north
texas
state
university
where
he
majored
in
english
literature
and
took
especially
to
the
works
of
emerson
