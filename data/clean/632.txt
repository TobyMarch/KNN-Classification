fabolous
scored
a
bit
hit
can't
deny
it
right
out
of
the
gate
in
2001
instantly
establishing
himself
as
a
rising
east
coast
rap
star
the
song's
combination
of
streetsavvy
toughness
and
pop
crossover
appeal
representative
of
the
rapper
himself
streetwise
and
hardened
yet
young
and
graced
with
posterboy
good
looks
the
brooklyn
rapper
(born
john
jackson
on
november
18
1977)
was
one
of
the
first
east
coast
mcs
to
embrace
the
bling
mentality
of
the
south
as
well
as
the
gangsta
swagger
of
the
west
coast
all
the
while
incorporating
a
subtle
undercurrent
of
poprap
into
his
music
he
was
among
the
first
of
a
new
breed
of
new
york
city
rappers
later
and
most
notably
to
include
50
cent
who
were
able
to
cross
over
well
among
multiple
markets
without
losing
street
credential
his
youth
was
key
but
so
was
his
bravado
and
when
fabolous
could
balance
this
persona
optimally
and
find
himself
a
production
formula
to
fit
commercial
success
resulted
his
breakthrough
single
can't
deny
it

a
rick
rock
production
featuring
a
2pac
sample
and
a
nate
dogg
feature
as
well
as
a
catchy
hook

preceded
his
debut
album
ghetto
fabolous
(2001)
and
generated
quite
a
bit
of
buzz
the
album
also
featured
production
work
by
the
neptunes
but
only
managed
one
other
single
young'n
which
failed
to
match
the
success
of
can't
deny
it
when
fabolous
returned
with
his
sophomore
album
street
dreams
(2003)
he
capitalized
on
his
initial
renown
racking
up
three
major
hits
trade
it
all
can't
let
you
go
and
into
you
with
the
latter
two
breaking
into
the
top
five
of
billboard's
hot
100
later
in
2003

the
mixtape
hit
stores
just
in
time
for
the
holiday
season
comprised
of
various
streetlevel
recordings
originally
released
on
mixtapes
this
compilation
didn't
spawn
any
hits
but
it
did
reaffirm
fabolous'
hiphop
credentials
in
the
wake
of
his
string
of
pop
crossover
singles
the
following
year
brought
with
it
another
album
real
talk
(2004)
which
didn't
offer
any
major
pop
crossover
hits
(baby
was
a
minor
one)
yet
did
boast
a
monster
just
blaze
production
breathe
which
further
shored
up
fabolous'
hiphop
credentials
the
young
rapper
took
most
of
2005
and
2006
off
and
shortly
before
the
scheduled
release
of
his
next
album
in
late
2006
he
made
headlines
when
he
was
shot
in
the
leg
and
subsequently
charged
with
weapons
possession
(police
found
two
guns
in
the
car
that
transported
him
to
the
hospital)
def
jam

which
signed
fabolous
after
sending
musiq
to
atlantic
in
a
unique
trade
situation

released
from
nothin'
to
somethin'
(2007)
the
album
debuted
at
number
one
on
billboard's
top
rb/hiphop
albums
chart
(number
two
overall)
and
spawned
a
series
of
singles
including
the
top
ten
hit
make
me
better
featuring
neyo
two
years
later
the
hit
single
throw
it
in
the
bag
would
land
on
his
album
loso's
way
a
loose
conceptual
fulllength
inspired
by
the
film
carlito's
way
in
2010
he
released
there
