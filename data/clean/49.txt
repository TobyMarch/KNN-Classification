bush
is
an
english
alternative
rock
band
formed
in
1992
the
group
chose
the
name
“bush”
because
they
used
to
live
in
shepherd’s
bush
london
their
first
album
sixteen
stone
(1994)
was
a
huge
commercial
success
almost
overnight
bush
went
from
playing
small
pubs
in
london
to
headlining
arenas
in
the
us
the
result
of
extensive
promotion
on
mtv
and
nonstop
touring
critics
labeled
them
as
an
inferior
derivative
of
bands
such
as
nirvana
and
pixies
and
this
criticism
followed
them
throughout
their
career
as
a
band
in
particular
rossdale’s
throaty
singing
voice
and
random
stream
of
consciousnessstyle
lyrics
were
dismissed
by
some
as
an
imitation
of
nirvana’s
lead
singer
kurt
cobain
although
the
band
reached
superstar
status
in
the
us
they
failed
to
have
much
impact
on
the
britpop
riddled
uk
charts
the
lone
exception
being
their
single
swallowed
which
reached
#7
a
change
in
record
labels
management
and
an
extended
hiatus
did
not
bode
well
for
the
band
who
unofficially
split
in
2002
on
june
21
2010
it
was
announced
that
bush
were
reuniting
there
will
be
a
new
album
called
“the
sea
of
memories”
(previously
named
as
“everything
always
now”)
two
original
members
rossdale
and
goodridge
are
joined
by
chris
traynor
and
corey
britz
the
release
will
be
their
first
indie
release
since
sixteen
stone
released
on
rossdale’s
own
zuma
rock
records
bush’s
albums
include
razorblade
suitcase
(produced
by
steve
albini)

that
whole
inferior
derivative
stigma
has
always
been
ridiculous
first
off
bush
is
better
than
nirvana
for
my
money
secondly
who
the
hell
said
nirvana
was
original?
honestly
the
whole
grunge
label
was
stupid
just
as
much
as
the
post
grunge
label
it's
rock
music
and
they're
just
varying
flavors
and
personalities
but
i
digress
i
think
bush
kicks
ass
glad
they're
back
together
