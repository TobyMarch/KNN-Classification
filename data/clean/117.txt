amazoncom
following
the
success
of
golden
smog's
second
release
down
by
the
old
mainstream
rykodisc
has
managed
to
reissue
this
1992
debut
ep
(originally
released
on
the
nowdefunct
crackpot
records)
unlike
their
later
release
this
disc
contains
no
originals
rather
it
is
filled
with
five
unlikely
covers
ranging
from
bad
company's
shooting
star
to
thin
lizzy's
cowboy
song
this
early
lineup
features
the
best
the
twin
cities
had
to
offerdan
murphy
(soul
asylum)
gary
louris
and
marc
perlman
(the
jayhawks)
craig
johnson
(run
westy
run)
and
chris
mars
(the
replacements)all
billed
under
golden
smog
pseudonyms
of
course
while
it
doesn't
resonate
with
any
majestic
brilliance
on
golden
smog
sounds
remarkably
like
five
friends
jamming
over
a
few
cases
of
beer
which
according
to
legend
is
how
golden
smog
came
to
be
it's
not
heavy
it's
not
deep
it's
just
a
lot
of
fun

from
sounding

opus

cd
before
no
depression
became
a
genre
before
jeff
tweedy
was
even
a
member
of
golden
smog
this
ep
was
issued
it's
a
rough
boozy
heartfelt
passionately
sloppy
take
on
some
rock
n
roll
classics
that
adds
up
to
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
what
makes
the
ep
significant
is
not
the
specific
song
choices
but
instead
the
overall
attitude
and
feel
of
the
music
this
is
why
altrock
fans
might
enjoy
this
one
even
if
they
don't
like
the
bands
whose
songs
were
being
covered
this
ep
coincides
with
soul
asylum
and
the
replacements
shifting
away
from
fastandfurious
garage
punk
towards
a
sound
inspired
by
folk
and
classic
rock
this
would
ultimately
meld
into
altcountry
with
bands
like
uncle
tupelo
the
jayhawks
and
later
whiskeytown
taking
the
idea
a
step
further
towards
classic
country
here
members
of
the
jayhawks
soul
asylum
and
others
try
out
the
new
sound
while
paying
homage
to
some
of
their
influences
the
music
is
passionate
in
an
offhanded
way
as
if
the
musicians
weren't
trying
too
hard
but
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
i
can
almost
picture
the
guys
sitting
around
a
room
with
bottles
of
beer
laughing
and
having
a
good
time
while
hitting
the
record
button
when
inspired
to
do
so
it's
the
way
rock
n
roll
was
supposed
to
be
made
i
think
the
current
music
scene
is
lacking
in
discs
like
this
it
all
sounds
so
sculpted
now
or
very
intentionally
lofi
there
is
precious
little
that
sounds
offthecuff
sculpted
intentionallycrafted
music
is
often
great
and
really
has
its
place
but
there
is
no
substitute
for
something
like
this
as
well
this
music
is
like
a
cold
beer
savor
it

february

by

formataudio
cd
this
debut
ep
from
the
supergroup
golden
smog
is
actually
very
lackingbut
only
in
it's
brevity
this
beautiful
and
rockin'
disc
is
brought
to
you
by
members
of
wilco
the
jayhawks
soul
asylum
and
run
westy
run
but
you
wouldn't
know
that
from
the
liner
notes
due
to
contract
stipulations
they
couldn't
use
their
real
names
on
this
debut
(
instead
they
use
aliases
created
by
combining
their
middle
names
and
street
they
grew
up
on
)
luckily
their
real
talent
still
shines
through
and
although
all
the
songs
on
here
are
covers
the
smog
breathes
new
life
into
these
70's
rockers
son
opens
the
cd
with
a
bouncy
fun
hook
that
you
can
not
help
but
tap
along
to
easy
to
be
hard
is
a
slow
ballad
that
explodes
in
the
chorus
and
will
bring
a
tear
to
your
eye
no
matter
how
hard
you
fight
it
back
then
we
move
on
to

shooting
star


a
cover
so
good
that
bad
company
called
up
the
smogsters
and
asked
them
record
their
next
album
for
them
since
these
guys
play
the
material
better
than
the
notso
good
corporation
ever
could
(
i
can't
back
that
claim
up
)
anyway
what
it
all
boils
down
to
is
you're
a
fan
of
the
no
depression

movement
and
you
need
to
know
whether
this
one
is
worthwhile
so
i
answer
you
by
saying
if
wilco
and
the
jayhawks
are
your
breed
of
catclick
that
shopping
cart
icon
and
if
not
give
it
a
try
anyway
i
bet
it's
better
than
that
britney
spears
cd
you're
debating
overand
cheaper
too
