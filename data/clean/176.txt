the

of
modern
english's
biggest
hit
i
melt
with
you
gave
listeners
the
impression
that
the
band
was
an
upbeat
pop
act
in
the
early
'80s
i
melt
with
you
was
actually
an
anomaly
in
modern
english's
early
discography
formed
in
colchester
england
in
1979
modern
english
was
originally
a
punk
group
called
the
lepers
featuring
robbie
grey
(vocals
guitar)
gary
mcdowell
(guitar)
and
richard
brown
(drums)
the
lepers
mainly
performed
at
parties
after
mick
conroy
(bass)
and
stephen
walker
(keyboards)
joined
the
band
they
changed
their
name
to
modern
english
and
were
signed
to
4ad
records
inspired
by
the
stylish
gloom
of
bauhaus
and
joy
division
modern
english
released
the
singles
swans
on

and
gathering

before
recording
their
1981
debut

boiling
with
raw
anger
dissonant
rhythms
and
weird
noises
mesh

lace
confused
some
uk
critics
while
mesmerizing
others
a
year
later
the
group
streamlined
their
sound
dropping
much
of
mesh

lace's
gothic
experimentation
on
after
the
snow
i
melt
with
you
was
included
on
the

girl
soundtrack
and
its
video
became
an
mtv
staple
although
i

you
didn't
reach
the
top
40
charts
in
america
after
the
snow
sold
more
than
500000
copies
however
the
band's
next
album
1984's
ricochet
days
was
a
flop
pressured
by
their
us
label
sire
records
to
release
another
hit
and
exhausted
from
touring
modern
english
began
falling
apart
walker
and
brown
were
fired
from
the
group
grey
continued
recording
with
different
modern
english
lineups
releasing
the
albums

in
1990
