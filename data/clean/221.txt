history
[edit]
formation
(1986)
[edit]
joey
santiago
and
black
francis
(born
charles
thompson
iv)
first
met
when
they
lived
next
to
each
other
in
a
suite
while
attending
the
university
of
massachusetts
amherst[1]
although
santiago
was
worried
about
distractions
he
noticed
francis
played
music
and
the
pair
began
to
jam
together[2]
francis
then
embarked
on
a
student
exchange
trip
to
puerto
rico
to
study
spanish[1]
after
six
months
he
returned
to
amherst
and
dropped
out
of
the
university[3]
francis
and
santiago
spent
1984
working
in
a
warehouse
with
francis
composing
songs
on
his
acoustic
guitar
and
writing
lyrics
on
the
subway
train[4]
the
pair
formed
a
band
in
january
1986[5]
bass
player
kim
deal
joined
santiago
and
francis
two
weeks
later
after
responding
to
a
classified
advertisement
francis
had
placed
seeking
a
female
bass
player
who
liked
both
folk
music
icons
peter
paul
and
mary
and
the
band
h&uumlsker
d&uuml[6]
deal
was
the
only
person
to
respond
but
arrived
at
the
audition
without
a
bass
as
she
had
never
played
the
instrument
before[7][8]
she
was
invited
to
join
the
band
just
because
she
liked
the
songs
black
francis
was
showing
her
she
later
obtained
a
bass
and
the
trio
started
rehearsing
in
deal's
apartment[9]
after
recruiting
deal
the
band
tried
unsuccessfully
to
get
her
sister
kelley
deal
to
join
as
its
drummer[10]
kim's
husband
suggested
they
hire
drummer
david
lovering
whom
kim
had
met
at
her
wedding
reception[11][12]
the
group
arrived
at
a
name
after
santiago
selected
the
word
pixies
randomly
from
a
dictionary
and
took
a
liking
to
how
it
looked
and
its
definition
as
mischievous
little
elves[1]
once
the
band
had
settled
on
a
name
and
stable
lineup
they
moved
rehearsals
to
lovering's
parents'
garage
in
mid1986[9][13]
they
began
to
play
shows
at
bars
in
and
around
the
boston
area[1]

[edit]
while
the
pixies
were
playing
a
concert
with
throwing
muses
they
were
noticed
by
producer
gary
smith
manager
of
fort
apache
studios[5]
he
told
the
band
he
could
not
sleep
until
you
guys

world
famous[14]
the
band
produced
a
17track
demo
at
fort
apache
soon
afterwards
known
to
fans
as
the
purple

because
of
the

purple
background
funded
by
francis'
father
at
the
cost
of
$1000
the
recording
session
was
completed
in
three
days[15]
local
promoter
ken
goes
became
the
band's
manager
and
he
passed
the
demo
to
ivo
wattsrussell
of
the
independent
record
label
4ad[1]
wattsrussell
nearly
passed
on
the
band
finding
them
too
normal
too
rock
'n'
roll
but
signed
them
at
the
persuasion
of
his
girlfriend[16]
upon
signing
with
4ad
eight
tracks
from
the
purple
tape
were
selected
for
the
come

the
band's
first
release[5]
on
it
francis
drew
upon
his
experiences
in
puerto
rico
mostly
in
the
songs
vamos
and
isla
de
encanta
the
album
included
lyrics
describing
the
poverty
in
puerto
rico[14]
the
religious
lyrics
in

and
later

came
from
his

and
released
in

1988[14]
surfer
rosa
gained
the
pixies
acclaim
in
europe
both
melody
maker
and
sounds
gave
surfer
rosa
their
album
of
the
year
award
american
critical
response
was
also
positive
yet
more
muted
a
reaction
that
persisted
for
much
of
the
band's
career[19]
the
album
was
eventually
certified
gold
in
the
us
in
2005[20]
after
the
album
was
released
the
band
arrived
in
england
to
support
throwing
muses
on
the
european
sex
and
death
tour—beginning
at
the
mean
fiddler
in
london[21]
the
tour
also
took
them
to
the
netherlands
where
the
pixies
had
already
received
enough
media
attention
to
be
headlining
the
tour
francis
later
recalled
the
first
place
i
made
it
with
the
pixies
was
in
holland[22]
the
tour
became
notable
for
the
band's
injokes
such
as
playing
their
entire
set
list
in
alphabetical
order[5]
meanwhile
the
pixies
signed
an
american
distribution
deal
with
major
record
label
elektra[5]
around
this
time
the
pixies
struck
up
a
relationship
with
the
british
producer
gil
norton
norton
produced
their
second
full
album
doolittle[23]
which
was
recorded
in
the
last
six
weeks
of
1988
and
seen
as
a
departure
from
the
raw
sound
of
come
on
pilgrim
and
surfer
rosa
doolittle
had
a
much
cleaner
sound
largely
due
to
norton
and
the
production
budget
of
us$40000
which
was
quadruple
that
of
surfer
rosa[24]
doolittle
featured
the
single
here

biographers
josh

and
caryn

hiatus
(1989–1990)
[edit]
after
doolittle
tensions
between
deal
and
francis
came
to
a
head
(for
example
francis
threw
a
guitar
at
deal
during
a
concert
in
stuttgart)[28]
and
deal
was
almost
fired
from
the
band
when
she
refused
to
play
at
a
concert
in
frankfurt[29]
santiago
in
an
interview
with
mojo
described
deal
as
being
headstrong
and
want[ing]
to
include
her
own
songs
to
explore
her
own
world
on
the
band's
albums
eventually
she
accepted
that
francis
was
the
singer
and
had
musical
control
of
the
band
but
after
the
frankfurt
incident
they
kinda
stopped
talking[29]
the
band
became
increasingly
tired
during
the
postdoolittle

francis
has
at
various
times
stated
that
the
pixies
recording
a
new
studio
album
was
either
a
possibility[83][84][85]
or
an
unlikelihood[86][87]
the
main
obstacle
being
deal's
reluctance
to
do
so[88][89]
to
celebrate
the
20th

of

release
of

musical
style
[edit]
the
pixies'
musical
style
has
been
described
as
an
unorthodox
marriage
of
surf
music
and
punk
rock

characterized
by
black's
bristling
lyrics
and
hackleraising
caterwaul
kim
deal's
whispered
harmonies
and
waspy
basslines
joey
santiago's
fragile
guitar
and
the
persistent
flush
of
david
lovering's
drums[40]
the
band's
music
incorporates
extreme
dynamic
shifts
francis
explained
in
1991
those
are
the
two
basic
components
of
rock
music
[

]
the
dreamy
side
and
the
rockin'
side
it's
always
been
either
sweaty
or
laid
back
and
cool
we
do
try
to
be
dynamic
but
it's
dumbo
dynamics
because
we
don't
know
how
to
do
anything
else
we
can
play
loud
or
quiet—that's
it[103]
influences
[edit]
the
pixies
draw
influence
from
a
range
of
artists
and
genres
each
member
came
from
a
different
musical
background
when
he
first
started
writing
songs
for
the
pixies
francis
says
he
was
listening
to
nothing
but
h&uumlsker
d&uuml
captain
beefheart
and
iggy
pop[104]
other
influences
associated
with
francis
include
the
gun
club[105]
and
the
cars[106][107]
during
the
making
of
doolittle
he
was
listening
heavily
to
the
beatles'
the
white
album[108]
he
has
cited
buddy
holly
as
a
model
for
his
compressed
songwriting[109]
santiago
listened
to
1970s
and
1980s
punk
including
black
flag
as
well
as
david
bowie[14]
guitarists
who
influenced
him
include
jimi
hendrix
les
paul
wes
montgomery
and
george
harrison[110]
deal's
musical
background
was
folk
music
and
country
she
had
formed
a
countryfolk
band
with
her
sister
in
her
teenage
years
and
played
covers
of
artists
such
as
the
everly
brothers
and
hank
williams[40]
other
artists
they
listened
to
included
xtc
gang
of
four
and
elvis
costello[111]
lovering
is
a
fan
of
the
band
rush[40]
other
media
such
as
film
has
had
an
impact
on
the
pixies
francis
cites
surrealist
films
eraserhead
and
un
chien
andalou
(as
mentioned
in
debaser)
as
influences[14]
he
has
commented
on
these
influences
saying
he
didn't
have
the
patience
to
sit
around
reading
surrealist
novels
but
found
it
easier
to
watch
twentyminute
films[112]
songwriting
and
vocals
[edit]
most
of
the
pixies
songs
were
composed
and
sung
by
francis
critic
stephen
thomas
erlewine
has
described
francis's
writing
as
containing
bizarre
fragmented
lyrics
about
space
religion
sex
mutilation
and
pop
culture[5]
biblical
violence
is
a
theme
of
doolittle's
dead
and
gouge
away[1][113]
francis
told
a
melody
maker
interviewer
it's
all
those
characters
in
the
old
testament
i'm
obsessed
with
them
why
it
comes
out
so
much
i
don't
know[114]
he
has
described
come
on
pilgrim's
caribou
as
being
about
reincarnation[1]
and
extraterrestrial
themes
appear
in
a
number
of
songs
on
bossanova[1]
deal
cowrote
doolittle's
silver
with
francis[115]
and
they
share
lead
harmony
vocals
on
the
track[15]
she
also
cowrote
and
sang
lead
vocals
on
surfer
rosa's
gigantic[116][117]
and
is
the
sole
songwriter
of
the
2004
digital
single
bam
thwok[111][118]
she
was
credited
as
mrs
john
murphy
on
the
former
composition[116]—at
the
time
she
was
married
and
she
used
this
name
as
an
ironic
feminist
joke[119]
she
also
sang
lead
vocals
on
the
song
into
the
white
(which
is
another
song
she
and
francis
cowrote)
and
the
neil
young
cover
winterlong
both
bsides[58]
lovering
sang
lead
vocals
on
doolittle's
la
la
love
you[115]
and
the
bside
make
believe[58]
impact
[edit]
although
the
pixies
produced
relatively
few
albums
whose
sales
were
modest
they
had
a
significant
influence
on
the
alternative
rock
boom
of
the
1990s[120][121]
gary
smith
who
produced
their
come
on
pilgrim
commented
on
the
band's
influence
on
alternative
rock
and
their
legacy
in
1997[121]
i've
heard
it
said
about
the
velvet
underground
that
while
not
a
lot
of
people
bought
their
albums
everyone
who
did
started
a
band
i
think
this
is
largely
true
about
the
pixies
as
well
charles'
secret
weapon
turned
out
to
be
not
so
secret
and
sooner
or
later
all
sorts
of
bands
were
exploiting
the
same
strategy
of
wide
dynamics
it
became
a
kind
of
new
pop
formula
and
within
a
short
while
smells
like
teen
spirit
was
charging
up
the
charts
and
even
the
members
of
nirvana
said
later
that
it
sounded
for
all
the
world
like
a
pixies
song
sonically
the
pixies
are
credited
with
popularizing
the
extreme
dynamics
and
stopstart
timing
that
would
become
widespread
in
alternative
rock
pixies
songs
typically
feature
hushed
restrained
verses
and
explosive
wailing
choruses[37]
artists
including
david
bowie
radiohead
pj
harvey
u2
nirvana
the
strokes
weezer
and
pavement
have
cited
admiration
of
or
influence
by
the
pixies[23][23][122][123]
bono
of
u2
has
called
the
pixies
one
of
america's
greatest
bands
ever[122][124]
and
radiohead's
thom
yorke
has
said
that
while
at
school
the
pixies
had
changed
my
life[121]
bowie
whose
own
music
had
inspired
francis
and
santiago
while
they
were
at
university
has
said
that
the
pixies
made
just
about
the
most
compelling
music
of
the
entire
80s[122]
one
notable
citation
as
an
influence
was
by
kurt
cobain
on
influencing
nirvana's
smells
like
teen
spirit
which
he
admitted
was
a
conscious
attempt
to
coopt
the
pixies'
style
in
a
january
1994
interview
with
rolling
stone
he
said
i
was
trying
to
write
the
ultimate
pop
song
i
was
basically
trying
to
rip
off
the
pixies
i
have
to
admit
it
[smiles]
when
i
heard
the
pixies
for
the
first
time
i
connected
with
that
band
so
heavily
i
should
have
been
in
that
band—or
at
least
in
a
pixies
cover
band
we
used
their
sense
of
dynamics
being
soft
and
quiet
and
then
loud
and
hard[121][125]
cobain
cited
surfer
rosa
as
one
of
his
main
musical
influences
and
particularly
admired
the
album's
natural
and
powerful
drum
sounds—a
result
of
steve
albini's
influence
on
the
record
albini
later
produced
nirvana's
1993
in
utero
at
the
request
of
cobain[126]
music
videos
and
dvds
[edit]
no
music
videos
were
released
from
come
on
pilgrim
or
surfer
rosa
but
from
doolittle
onwards
the
following
videos
were
made
monkey
gone
to
heaven
here
comes
your
man
velouria
dig
for
fire
allison
alec
eiffel
head
on
and
debaser[127]
these
were
later
released
on
the
2004
dvd
pixies[127]
furthermore
a
music
video
accompanied
the
release
of
their
2013
song
bagboy
as
well
an
alternate
video
released
on
a
later
date
videos
have
been
made
for
all
the
songs
in
ep1
the
videos
for
here
comes
your
man
and
allison
were
also
released
on
the
complete
'b'
sides[58]
by
bossanova
the
band
had
developed
a
severe
aversion
to
recording
music
videos
and
francis
refused
to
lipsync
to
them[128]
for
example
in
the
here
comes
your
man
video
both
black
and
deal
open
their
mouths
wide
instead
of
mouthing
their
lyrics[129]
according
to
the
record
label
this
became
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
pixies
never
achieved
major
coverage
on
mtv[128]
with
bossanova's
release
4ad
hoped
to
get
the
pixies
chosen
to
perform
their
single
velouria
on
the
bbc
music
program
top
of
the
pops[130]
to
this
end
the
band
was
pressured
into
producing
a
video
for
the
song
and
they
made
one
cheaply
with
the
band
members
filmed
running
down
a
quarry
shown
in
slow
motion[128][131]
the
group
was
ultimately
not
given
a
spot
on
the
show[131][132]
a
90minute
documentary
called
loudquietloud
a
film
about
the
pixies
directed
by
steven
cantor
and
matthew
galkin
was
released
in
2006
the
film
documents
their
2004
reunion
and
tour
and
covers
the
years
after
the
breakup[133]
in
addition
to
pixies
and
loudquietloud
four
other
pixies'
dvds
were
released
between
2004
and
2006
all
featuring
concert
performances

at
