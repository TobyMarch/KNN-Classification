hello
all
some
of
you
may
have
already
heard
that
our
good
friend
benjamin
curtis
(secret
machines

of

bells)
has
been
undergoing
treatment
for
cancer
recently
he
was
informed
that
he
will
need
a
bone
marrow
transplant
no
one
in
his
immediate
family
is
a
marrow
type
match
unfortunately
so
we
would
like
to
spread
the
word
about
the
website
marroworg

a
registry
of
willing
donors

in
the
hopes
that
it
will
lead
to
benjamin
and
many
others
receiving
a
speedy
transplant
from
some
brave
person
if
you
go
to
the
site
to
register
they
will
send
you
a
free
test
kit

you
swab
your
cheek
and
send
it
back
to
them

and
bam…you’re
making
a
difference
in
the
world
obviously
it’s
quite
a
commitment
we
just
want
to
spread
awareness
that
such
a
registry
exists
and
that
it’s
important
thanks
so
much
for
your
time

and

five
years

this
was
a
memorable
moment
for

never
had
any
expectations
for
how
the

would

received&nbsp

just
wanted
to
present
our
music
as
an
album
to
anyone
who
would
be
open
to
hearing
it&nbsp
it
was
incredible
to
finally
tour
and
see
people
react
to
these
songs&nbsp
we
never
could
have
imagined
that
the
album
would
have
reached
so
many
people
throughout
the
world&nbsp
we
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
this
past
year
digging
through
our
archives
and
asking
others
to
dig
through
theirs
in
the
hopes
of
uncovering
some
forgotten
material&nbsp
the
result
of
our
hunting
and
gathering
has
yielded
this
tenth
