[edit]
1994–1998
formation
and
early
years
[edit]
the
members
of
muse
played
in
separate
school
bands
during
their
stay
at
teignmouth
community
college
in
the
early
1990s
but
the
formation
of
muse
began
when
bellamy
successfully
auditioned
for
the
part
of
guitarist
in
dominic
howard's
band
carnage
mayhem
they
asked
chris
wolstenholme
–
who
played
the
drums
at
the
time
–
to
learn
to
play
bass
guitar
for
the
band
wolstenholme
agreed
and
took
up
lessons
while
bellamy
had
to
become
singer
and
songwriter
for
the
band[9][10]
the
other
original
band
members
left
after
bellamy
suggested
that
they
write
their
own
songs
rather
than
doing
covers
bellamy
and
howard's
first
band
name
was
gothic
plague
they
later
changed
the
name
to
fixed
penalty
and
then
to
rocket
baby
dolls[11]
in
1994
the
band
used
the
name
rocket
baby
dolls[12]
with
a
goth/glam
image
to
compete
in
a
local
battle
of
the
bands
the
band
won
the
contest
smashing
their
equipment
in
the
process[13][14]
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
protest
a
statement
bellamy
said
so
when
we
actually
won
it
was
a
real
shock
a
massive
shock
after
that
we
started
taking
ourselves
seriously
shortly
after
the
contest
the
three
decided
to
forget
university
quit
their
jobs
change
the
band
name
to
muse
(1994–1995)
and
move
away
from
teignmouth[15]
the
name
muse
was
supposedly
inspired
by
matthew
bellamy's
art
teacher
samuel
theoun
the
band
liked
that
it
was
short
and
thought
that
it
looked
good
on
a
poster[16]
music
journalist
mark
beaumont
writes
in
his
biography
of
the
band
that
they
wanted
the
name
to
reflect
the
sense
matt
had
that
he
had
somehow
'summoned
up'
this
band
the
way
mediums
could
summon
up
inspirational
spirits
at
times
of
emotional
need[17]

melancholic
musical

during

of
the

second
album
origin

(2001)
the
band
experimented
with
instrumentation
such
as
a
church
organ
mellotron
animal
bones
and
an
expanded
drum
kit
there
were
more
of
bellamy's
highpitched
vocal
lines
arpeggiated
guitar
and
piano
playing
bellamy
cites
guitar
influences
such
as
jimi
hendrix
and
tom
morello
(of
rage
against
the
machine
and
audioslave)
the
latter
evident
in
the
more
riffbased
songs
in
origin
of
symmetry
and
in
bellamy's
extensive
use
of
pitchshifting
effects
in
his
solos[22]
the
album
also
features
a
reworking
of
anthony
newley
and
leslie
bricusse's
feeling
good[23]
the
track
was
later
used
as
the
backing
for
a

muse
threatened
celine
dion
with
legal
action
when

as

despite
the
band
owning
the

rights
to

dion
offered
muse
$50000
for
the
rights
but
they
turned
it
down

stated
that
we
don't
want
to
turn
up
there
with

was
well
received
by
critics

gave
the
album
9/10
with
roger
morton
writing
it's
amazing
for
such
a
young
band
to
load
up
with
a
heritage
that
includes
the
darker
visions
of
cobain
and
kafka
mahler
and
the
tiger
lillies
cronenberg
and
schoenberg
and
make
a
sexy
populist
album
but
muse
have
carried
it
off[26]
maverick
had
reservations
about
bellamy's
vocal
style
on
this
album
(considering
it
not
to
be
radiofriendly)
and
asked
muse
to
change
some
of
their
songs
prior
to
us
release
the
band
refused
and
left
maverick
resulting
in
maverick's
decision
not
to
release
origin
of
symmetry
in
the
united
states[27]
the
album
was
finally
released
in

the

leg
of
the
2004
tour
began
ominously
as
bellamy
injured
himself
on
stage
during
the
opening
show
in
atlanta[30]
the
tour
resumed
after
bellamy
got
several
stitches
and
had
a
couple
of
days
of
rest
the

also
played
at

described
the

as
the
best
gig
of

drummer
dominic
howard's
father
william
howard
who
attended
the
festival
to
watch
the
band
died
from
a
heart
attack
shortly
after
the
performance
it
was
the
biggest
feeling
of
achievement
we've
ever
had
after
coming
offstage
bellamy
said
it
was
almost
surreal
that
an
hour
later
his
dad
died
it
was
almost
not
believable
we
spent
about
a
week
sort
of
just
with
dom
trying
to
support
him
i
think
he
was
happy
that
at
least
his
dad
got
to
see
him
at
probably
what
was
the
finest
moment
so
far
of
the
band's
life[13]

[edit]
during

the

performed
two
songs
from
their
1990's
bside
library
that
had
not
been
played
in

years
agitated
and
yes
please
both
songs
were
not
on
the
original
setlist
for
the
gig
following
the
gig
bellamy
said
we
haven't
played
those
songs
in
like
6
years
something
like
that
that
was
a
rehearsal
that's
what
the
next
album
sounds
like
okay?[111]
he
also
stated
how
the
band
plans
to
return
to
the
studio
in
2014
after
a
short
break
on
november
25
2013
bellamy
said
he
expected
muse's
seventh
album
to
be
released
in
early
2015
saying
the
last
two
albums
we
sort
of
veered
away
from
our
instruments
a
little
bit
we
sort
of
focused
on
things
like
synthesisers
drum
machines
and
various
electronics
and
stuff
i
kind
of
feel
like
on
this
next
album
we’re
going
to
veer
back
towards
musicianship
again
and
focusing
on
our
own
instruments
guitar
bass
and
drums
it’s
probably
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
rawer
album
and
definitely
a
bit
more
rock
i’d
say[112]
bellamy
also
mentioned
the
possibility
of
a
concept
album
and
a
nonconventional
release[113]
musical
style
[edit]
muse
are
an
alternative
rock
band
and
are
often
associated
with
space
rock
and
progressive
rock[3]
their
music
currently
mixes
sounds
from
genres
such
as
electronic
music
hard
rock
experimental
rock
classical
music
rock
opera
and
many
others[114]
the
band
was
described
as
a
trashy
threepiece
by
matthew
bellamy
on
the
bbc
during
2002[115]
on
the
band's
association
with
progressive
rock
dominic
howard
has
said
i
associate
it
[progressive
rock]
with
10minute
guitar
solos
but
i
guess
we
kind
of
come
into
the
category
a
lot
of
bands
are
quite
ambitious
with
their
music
mixing
lots
of
different
styles
–
and
when
i
see
that
i
think
it's
great
i've
noticed
that
kind
of
thing
becoming
a
bit
more
mainstream[116]
stylistic
changes
[edit]
for
their
second
origin
of
symmetry
(2001)
album
the
band
wanted
to
enhance
their
sound
into
a
more
progressive
confident
and
aggressive
sound
looking
back
(chris
regarding
to
the
sound
of
their
previous
album)
there
isn't
much
difference
sonically
between
the
mellow
stuff
and
the
heavier
tracks
the
heavy
stuff
really
could
have
been
a
lot
heavier
and
that's
what
we
want
to
do
with
this
album
[117]
their
third
release
absolution
(2003)
followed
its
predecessor's
tendency
increasing
the
band's
heaviness
and
intensity
alongside
its
ambitious
thematics
the
album
also
features
songs
with
prominent
string
arrangements
and
starts
to
draw
influences
from
artists
such
as
queen[118]
their
fourth
album
black
holes
and
revelations
(2006)
is
a
more
electronica
–
and
space
rock
–
oriented
album
though
some
tracks
keep
the
heaviness
of
the
band's
previous
work
while
others
show
a
more
melodic
style
akin
to
the
musical
style
of
their
first
album
showbiz
(1999)
black
holes
and
revelations
was
influenced
by
artists
like
depeche
mode
and
lightning
bolt
as
well
by
various
styles
of
asian
and
european
music
such
as
naples
music
additionally
the
band
listened
to
radio
stations
from
the
middle
east
during
the
album's
recording
sessions[119]
muse's
fifth
album
the
resistance
(2009)
is
centred
on
the
symphonic
rock
and
progressive
rock
genres
as
demonstrated
in
the
tracks
resistance
and
the
exogenesis
symphony
although
in
places
it
is
sonically
softer
than
its
predecessors
it
still
contains
a
number
of
'heavy'
compositions
the
album
is
heavily
influenced
by
classical
music
as
well
as
rock
acts
such
as
queen
ultravox
(guiding
light
features
a
heavy
vienna
influence)
and
u2
queen's
guitarist
brian
may
has
praised
muse's
work
calling
the
band
extraordinary
musicians
who
let
their
madness
show
through
always
a
good
thing
in
an
artist[120]
muse's
sixth
album
the
2nd
law
(2012)
has
a
much
broader
range
of
influences
ranging
from
funk
and
film
scores
to
electronica
and
dubstep
the
2nd
law
is
influenced
by
rock
acts
such
as
queen
and
led
zeppelin
(on
supremacy)
as
well
as
dubstep
producer
skrillex
and
nero
(on
the
2nd
law
unsustainable[121]
and
follow
me
with
the
latter
being
coproduced
by
nero)
michael
jackson
stevie
wonder
(on
panic
station
which
features
musicians
who
performed
on
stevie
wonder's
superstition[122])
and
hans
zimmer[123]
additionally
the
album
marks
the
first
performance
of
bassist
chris
wolstenholme
on
lead
vocals
who
wrote
two
songs
for
the
album
about
his
battle
with
alcoholism
–
save
me
and
liquid
state[124]
critics
have
made
comparisons
between
muse's
early
work
with
the
one
from
the
english
alternative
rock
band
radiohead
with
criticism
directed
towards
bellamy's
vocal
style
additionally
in
a
1999
issue
of
the
french
magazine
rock
sound
bellamy
named
the
bends
by
radiohead
and
nirvana's
nevermind
as
the
most
important
albums
of
the
decade[125][126]
however
since
then
the
band
have
clarified
these
statements
various
times[127]
and
have
stated
that
what
they
meant
to
say
was
that
nirvana
and
radiohead
were
the
most
successful
alternative
rock
bands
in
the
1990s
and
were
influential
to
many
bands
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
radiohead
was
an
influence
for
them
on
the
other
hand
muse
acknowledges
nirvana
as
a
major
influence[128]
bellamy
has
stated
various
times
that
radiohead
really
don't
do
much
for
[him]
and
attributes
the
similarities
to
the
fact
that
both
bands
are
notably
influenced
by
the
alternative
rock
musician
jeff
buckley[129]
musical
approaches
[edit]
many
muse
songs
are
recognisable
by
lead
vocalist
matthew
bellamy's
use
of
vibrato
falsetto
and
melismatic
phrasing
influenced
primarily
by
jeff
buckley[129]
as
pianist
matt
bellamy
often
utilises
the
broken
chords
technique
(arpeggio)
on
several
pianobased
songs
some
influences
in
bellamy's
playing
include
late
classical
and
romantic
era
composers
such
as
sergei
rachmaninov
(in
butterflies
and
hurricanes)
pyotr
tchaikovsky
hector
berlioz
ludwig
van
beethoven
franz
liszt
camille
saintsa&eumlns
(in
i
belong
to
you
(mon
coeur
s'ouvre
&agrave
ta
voix))
and
fr&eacuted&eacuteric
chopin
(in
united
states
of
eurasia)
among
others
he
also
draws
influence
from
more
contemporary
composers
namely
steve
reich
and
philip
glass[130]
in
several
muse
songs
the
bass
line
is
used
as
the
central
motif
often
with
the
guitar
providing
an
extra
layer
to
the
song
the
bass
line
adds
embellishments
in
the
lower
register
the
bass
usually
is
fuzz
bass
an
overdriven
distorted
tone
other
electronic
effects
are
also
applied
to
the
bass
tone
to
achieve
a
greater
weight
and
depth
this
allows
the
bass
guitar
to
serve
as
counterfoil
to
the
main
chord
progression
often
playing
higher
notes
or
electronic
sounds
both
bass
and
guitar
also
play
unison
parts
on
occasion
adding
emphasis
to
specific
melodies
and
riffs
(see
hysteria
postsecond
chorus
dead
star
main
riff)
both
matt
and
chris
use
touch
screen
controllers
often
built
into
their
instruments
this
touch
screen
can
control
a
variety
of
synthesisers
and
digital
effects
pedals
but
is
most
often
used
with
a
korg
kaoss
pad
and/or
a
digitech
whammy
pedal[131]
as
a
guitarist
bellamy
often
utilises
arpeggiator
and
pitchshift
effects
to
create
a
more
electronic
sound
citing
jimi
hendrix
and
tom
morello
as
influences
for
this
method[22]
in
contrast
his
guitar
playing
is
also
influenced
by
a
more
classical
harmonic
aesthetic
particularly
the
style
of
latin
and
spanish
guitar
music
as
matt
bellamy
cites
i
learnt
some
spanish
guitar
music
that
opened
up
a
world
of
different
harmonies
and
making
music
and
a
different
sort
of
passion
very
heavy
music
but
it
hasn't
got
a
distortion
pedal[132]
lyrical
[edit]
most
earlier
muse
songs
lyrically
dealt
with
introspective
themes
including
relationships
social
alienation
and
difficulties
they
had
encountered
while
trying
to
establish
themselves
in
their
hometown
however
with
the
band's
progress
their
song
concepts
have
become
more
ambitious
addressing
issues
such
as
the
fear
of
the
evolution
of
technology
in
their
origin
of
symmetry
(2001)
album
they
deal
mainly
with
the
apocalypse
in
absolution
(2003)
and
with
catastrophic
war
in
black
holes
and
revelations
(2006)
the
resistance
(2009)
was
a
concept
album
based
around
the
plot
and
themes
of
nineteen
eightyfour
by
george
orwell
their
latest
album
the
2nd
law
(2012)
relates
to
economics
thermodynamics
and
apocalyptic
themes
books
that
have
influenced
muse's
lyrical
themes
include
nineteen
eightyfour
by
george
orwell[133]
