biography
during
the
transitional
period
of
the
early
1970s
paul
kantner
(founding
member
of
jefferson
airplane)
recorded
blows
against
the
empire
a
concept
album
featuring
an
ad
hoc
group
of
musicians
that
he
dubbed
jefferson
starship
marking
the
first
use
of
that
name
this
edition
of
jefferson
starship
(such
as
it
was)
included
members
of
crosby
stills
nash

young
(david
crosby
and
graham
nash)
and
members
of
grateful
dead
(jerry
garcia
phil
lesh
bill
kreutzmann
and
mickey
hart)
as
well
as
some
of
the
remaining
members
of
jefferson
airplane
(grace
slick
marty
balin
joey
covington
and
jack
casady)
by
1973
after
the
breakup
of
jefferson
airplane
with
kaukonen
and
casady
now
devoting
their
full
attention
to
hot
tuna
several
of
the
musicians
who
worked
on
kantner
slick
and
freiberg’s
album
“baron
von
tollbooth

the
chrome
nun”
formed
the
core
of
a
new
lineup
that
was
formally
reborn
as
“jefferson
starship”
in
1974
kantner
slick
and
freiberg
were
charter
members
the
lineup
also
included
lateairplane
holdovers
drummer
john
barbata
marty
balinand
fiddler
papa
john
creach
(who
also
played
with
hot
tuna)
along
with
pete
sears
(who
like
freiberg
played
bass
and
keyboards)
and
twentyyearold
guitarist
craig
chaquico
eventually
slick’s
alcoholism
became
a
problem
which
led
to
two
nights
of
disastrous
concerts
in
germany
in
1978
the
first
night
fans
ransacked
the
stage
when
slick
failed
to
appear
the
following
night
slick
in
a
drunken
stupor
shocked
the
audience
by
using
profanity
and
sexual
references
throughout
most
of
her
songs
