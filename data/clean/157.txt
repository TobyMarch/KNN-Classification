montreal
trio
land
of
talk
spearheaded
by
vocalist
and
songwriter
elizabeth
powell
have

their
sophomore
fulllength
album
cloak
and
cipher
joining
powell
on
the
album
are
eoin
o
laoghaire
(bass)
and
andrew
barr
(drums)
and
special
guests
drawn
from
the
montreal
music
scene
and
beyond
including
patrick
watson
as
well
as
members
of
stars
silver
mount
zion
band
wintersleep
besnard
lakes
arcade
fire
and
esmerine
the
follow
up
to
2008's
critically
adored
debut
lp
some
are
lakes
cloak
and
cipher's
ten
tracks
mark
an
electric
step
forward
for
the
band
musically
and
sonically
establishing
land
of
talk
as
one
of
canada's
most
exciting
new
musical
voices
recorded
in
montreal's
breakglass
studios
in
the
fall
of
2009
with
producer
jace
lasek
(besnard
lakes
wolf
parade
sunset
rubdown)
the
return
to
the
studio
was
a
homecoming
of
sorts
after
nearly
two
years
of
life
on
the
road
that
was
punctuated
by
the
release
of
2009's
fun
and
laughter
ep
following
the
release
of
some
are
lakes
land
of
talk
joined
broken
social
scene
on
a
north
american
tour
where
in
addition
to
opening
the
show
powell
joined
the
collective
on
stage
nightly
and
left
critics
taking
note
including
the
new
york
times
raving
in
their
live
review
[powell]
proved
herself
a
strong
guitarist
and
a
calmly
arresting
lead
singer
she
made
a
virtue
of
directness
and
brevity
letting
small
details
speak
for
themselves
while
the
buzz
around
some
are
lakes
was
steadily
growing
these
staggering
live
sets
brought
attention
to
powell's
standout
voice
and
undeniable
presence
as
a
frontwoman
to
watch
with
the
release
of
cloak
and
cipher
it's
clear
that
powell
and
company
took
the
power
of
these
live
shows
and
focused
them
into
a
more
complex
textured
and
sophisticated
musical
composition
this
record
is
the
document
of
powell's
past
and
future
cleaved
together
in
those
teenage
years
an
analog
child
her
recordings
were
strictly
to
4track
tape
cloak
and
cipher's
songs
were
roughed
out
in
the
digital
garageband
software
a
first
for
powell
it
afforded
her
the
space
to
return
to
her
old
process

isolated
quiet
layered
construction
realized
in
the
studio
these
songs
became
vast
yet
intricate
expansive
arrangements
anchored
by
taut
instrumentation
the
lyrics
are
borrowed
newspaper
headlines
veiled
confessions
and
passages
from
books
annihilated
and
morphed
into
song
tracks
like
hamburg
noon
swing
tensely
between
acrobatic
vocals
and
rumbling
guitars
while
swift
coin
roars
to
the
fore
like
an
eviscerating
siren
exploding
into
a
rollicking
and
joyous
guitar
anthem
the
halfway
point
the
hate
i
won't
commit
featuring
a
piano
solo
from
patrick
watson
weaves
between
abrasive
and
gentle
expanding
through
choral
backing
vocals
and
distressed
emotive
pleas
from
powell
quarry
hymns
is
the
sweetest
and
saddest
land
of
talk
you
will
hear
insistently
driven
by
arcade
fire's
jeremy
gara
on
drums
the
record
concludes
with
the
dreamy
and
ethereal
better
and
closer
gently
rocking
you
asunder
