guitarist
nigel
pulsford
in
1992
the
two
bonded
over
an
appreciation
of
the
american
alternative
rock
group
the
pixies
the
two
formed
a
new
band
which
they
called
future
primitive
describing
the
early
sound
of
the
group
one
british
record
label
executive
said
years
later
they
weren't
what
they
are
today
–
they
were
a
little
like
the
more
commercial
side
of
inxs[8]
the
pair
then
recruited
bassist
dave
parsons
(formerly
of
the
partisans
and
transvision

and
drummed
with
several
different
drummers
(one
being

deal
with

the
band
completed
recording
its
debut
album
sixteen
stone
in
early
1994
however
the
death
of
disney
executive
frank
g
wells
eliminated
a
supporter
for
kahane
and
executives
at
hollywood
deemed
bush's
album
unacceptable
for
release
as
a
result
the
members
of
bush
took
jobs
performing
menial
labour
interscope
records
ultimately
decided
to
release
the
album
and
at
the
end
of
1994
kahane
sent
an
advance
copy
of
the
album
to
a
friend
at
influential
los

added

saw

rearranging

than
a
year
after

the
science
of
things
(1999–2000)
[edit]
following
the
completion
of
touring
rossdale
went
into
seclusion
in
ireland
where
he
worked
on
material
for
the
group's
next
album
rossdale
periodically
sent
demo
tapes
of
his
works
in
progress
to
his
bandmates
the
group
finally
convened
to
record
in
london
in
august
1998
where
the
band
reteamed
with
sixteen
stone
producers
clive
langer
and
alan
winstanley[9]
the
release
of
the
science
of
things
was
held
up
by
a
court
battle
between
the
band
and
trauma
records
the
case
was
settled
in
early
1999
and
the
album
was
finally
released
that
october[10]
the
science
of
things
was
a
major
departure
in
several
forms
from
bush's
first
two
albums
like
the
multiplatinum
successes
of
bush's
first
two
albums
this
album
also
reached
platinum
status
also
while
the
band's
previous
albums
were
strongly
influenced
by
grunge
the
science
of
things
featured
some
electronic
music
influences
that
distinguished
the
work
from
bush's
earlier
sound
for
example
although
lead
single
the
chemicals
between
us
had
a
prominent
guitar
riff
it
also
had
many
electronic
elements
usually
found
in
dance
music
although
the
album
had
a
few
hit
songs
it
failed
to
chart
within
the
top
10
the
band's
performance
at
woodstock
'99
however
helped
the
science
of
things
achieve
platinum
status
despite
its
slow
start
three
singles
were
released
from
the
science
of
things
most
notably
the
chemicals
between
us
which
spent
five
weeks
at
no&nbsp1
on
the
modern
rock
tracks
and
peaked
at
no&nbsp67
on
the
us
hot
100

on

considerable
airplay

released
its
next
album
golden

while
the
album
attempted
to
return
to
the
simple
catchy
sound
of
the
band's
debut
it
failed
to
achieve
the
same
commercial
success
as
the
band's
previous
releases
several
singles
were
released
most
notably
the
hit
the
people
that
we
love
(speed

but
none
were
mainstream
successes
the

was
the

least
successful
selling

over
on
lead
guitar
for
the
subsequent
tour
which
would
turn
out
to
be
bush's
last
for
8
years
due
to
declining
record
sales
and
a
lack
of
support
from

each
time
i
do
a
record
i’d
ask
him
to
do
it
he's
happy
and
it's
not
something
he
wanted
to
do
–
he
has
a
family
i
spoke
to
dave
i
was
surprised
because
i
thought
he’d
do
it
he
thought
about
it
for
the
weekend
and
then
said
he
couldn’t
he
didn’t
want
to
commit
and
then
back
out
–
he
didn’t
know
how
long
he
could
tour
it's
an
absurd
amount
of
work[12]
