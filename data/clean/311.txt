sound
drew
from
a
variety
of
musical
influences
including
jazz

came
closest

roll
despite
the
prominence
of
punk
rock
during
the
band's
early

strippeddown
sound
contrasted
with

demonstrating
a
more
rootsy
influence

emerged
from

of

were
melancholic[3]

a

the
attention
of
ar

working
at
warner

records
in
new
york
city
she
felt
that
it
was
the
kind
of
music
audiences
were
hungry
for
but
only
one
person
in
her
department
agreed
at
first[11]
many
of
the
songs
on
the
album
reflected
mark

experiences
in

after
the
rereleased
sultans

one
of

biggest
hits
and
became
a
fixture
in
the
band's
live
performances
bob
dylan
who
had
seen

released
their
final
studio
album
on

in
september
1991
which
although
a
highly
anticipated
release
met
with
more
moderate
success
and
mixed
reviews
as
well
as
a
significantly
reduced
audience
despite
dire
straits'
previous
international
success
some
reviewers
including
the
all

guide[47]
dubbed
on
every
street
as
an
'underwhelming'
followup
to
brothers
in

however
it
still
managed
to
sell
8
million
copies
reaching
number
one
in

failed
to
