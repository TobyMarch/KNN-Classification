personally
i
think
they
sound
the
same
that
is
weird
because
i
noticed
that
the
otherday
i
was
listening
to
the
both
of
them
(lick
it
up

kiss
and
jailbreakthin
lizzy
in
case
you
were
wondering)

hardly
kiss
is
glam
rock
with
an
attitude
i
consider
their
first
live
album
to
be
one
of
their
best
albums
ever
i
refuse
to
listen
to
any
of
their
studio
albums
that
preceded
the
1st
live
albums
because
i
think
they
deliberately
played
the
studio
versions
at
a
slower
tempo
so
fans
(like
me)
would
buy
only
the
live
album
thin
lizzy
was
mostly
hard
rock
with
a
scattering
of
slow
ballads
given
what
i
consider
to
be
heavy
metal
thin
lizzy
is
borderline
heavy
metal
and
i'm
more
than
a
casual
fan
i
grew
up
listening
to
thin
lizzy
back
in
the
mid
to
late
70's
at
one
point
or
another
i've
owned
thin
lizzy
albums
in
the
following
formats
8track
cassette
vinyl
and
of
course
cd
