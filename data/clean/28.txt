twenty

ago
today
bj&oumlrk
made
her
debut
which
landed
at
#29
on
our
list
of
the
best
albums
of
the
1990s
in
2011
while
american
critics
perhaps
still
beating
off
to
the
us's
exalted
altrock
movement
were
divided
on
the
album
at
the
time
of
its
release
it's
aged
remarkably
well
and
even
if
bj&oumlrk
hadn't
gone
on
to
record
her
masterpieces
post
and
homogenic
debut
was
enough
to
cement
her
legacy
as
one
of
pop's
most
forwardthinking
performers
and
that
includes
her
contributions
to
the
music
video
form
10
human
behaviour
(dir
michel
gondry)
bj&oumlrk's
very
first
music
video
as
a
solo
artist
was
also
the
start
of
a
fruitful
professional
relationship
with
innovative
director
michel
gondry
who
would
go
on
to
helm
a
total
of
eight
videos
for
the
singer
human
behaviour
isn't
their
most
successful
collaboration
but
it
literally
set
the
stage
for
both
their
careers
9
mutual
core
(dir
andrew
thomas
huang)
eric
henderson
calls
this
video
little
tectonic
plate
of
horrors
the
lyrics
to
mutual
core
sometimes
feel
like
bj&oumlrk
is
reading
from
a
science
textbook
(as
fast
as
your
fingernail
grows/the
atlantic
ridge
drifts)
but
the
video
a
sort
of
sequel
to
the
gondrydirected
1997
clip
for
j&oacutega
brings
the
song
to
explosive
life
with
bj&oumlrk
naturally
in
the
role
of
neglected
mother
nature

isobel
(dir
gondry)
while
making
suggestions
for
this
list
ed
gonzalez
referred
to
the
surreal
visually
striking
isobel
bj&oumlrk's
third
video
with
gondry
as
jean
epsteinian
kabuki
horror

triumph
of
a
heart
(dir
spike
jonze)
to
quote
gonzalez
again
this
time
from
our
list
of
the
best
music
videos
of
the
aughts
letting
off
steam
has
never
felt
so
touchingly
conveyed
as
it
does
in
this
quirky
and
unexpectedly
poetic
rumination
on
the
nature
of
affection
and
dependency
6
pagan
poetry
(dir
nick
knight)
long
before
lady
gaga
donned
alexander
mcqueen
and
hired
nick
knight
to
direct
her
born
this
way
music
video
bj&oumlrk
was
stirring
up
controversy
with
pagan
poetry
which
was
banned
by
mtv
in
2001
about
a
woman
preparing
herself
for
marriage
the
clip
features
scenes
of
oral
sex
reportedly
shot
privately
by
the
singer
herself
and
a
topless
bj&oumlrk
literally
sewing
herself
into
her
gown

well
disagree
we
shall
perhaps
aging
isn't
what
i
think
about
when
i
listen
to
the
album
i
mean
most
people's
definition
of
this
is
to
compare
one
album
to
another
and
as
i
think
anyone
else
here
can
agree
debut
and
erotica
are
extremely
different
as
much
as
bjork
is
my
favorite
artist
bar
none
my
favorite
bjork
song
doesn't
crack
my
top
5
(i
was
going
to
say
10
but
human
behaviour
is
just
that
good)
but
madonna's
secret
garden
(from
erotica
of
course)
is
#2
anyone
who
tries
to
tell
me
the
beats
on
that
song
have
aged
badly
will
be
drowned
out
by
my
intense
undying
love
for
it
i
already
said
i
agree
several
songs
aren't
great
where
life
begins
and
in
this
life
especially
but
if
you're
going
to
compare
it
to
anything
try
comparing
it
to
something
that
sounds
like
it's
in
the
same
subgenre
you
can't
compare
anything
in
19911993
to
crying
or
violently
happy
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
bjork
as
dynamic
enduring
legendary
and
revered
as
she
is

i
am
surprised
with
this
list
it
ignores
army
of
me
a
more
interesting
entry
than
declare
independence
and
places
her
masterpiece
pagan
poetry
on
a
spot
lower
than
number

i
wouldn't
put
debut
and
erotica
in
the
same
category
to
me
bjork
started
with
a
simple
even
if
sophisticated
opus
which
she
never
repeated
as
her
music
and
lyrics
became
more
complex
and/or
more
abstract
with
each
release
despite
like
a
prayer's
fame
as
madonna's
first
mature
album
erotica
to
me
represents
some
sort
of
peak
(and
to
me
her
career
has
several
peaks)
yes
the
technohousepopdance
beats
sound
dated
and
of
its
time
but
the
lyrics
are
so
interesting
and
the
melodies
are
kind
of
hypnotic
her
musical
influences
are
limitless
from
flamenco
to
classical
music
from
hiphop
to
jazz
lyrically
the
album
is
a
strange
mix
of
heartbreak
sexual
bliss
and
disease
for
me
debut
was
a
promising
starting
point
that
never
developed
in
the
direction
that
could
be
expected
erotica
is
this
bold
album
that
sees
madonna
at
her
most
creative
and
radical

i
respectfully
disagree
)
the
beats
on
the
cd
have
aged
kind
of
badly
in
my
opinion
on
many
of
the
songs
the
percussion
sounds
off
to
my
ears
(like
in
waiting)
weirdly
many
of
the
remixes
of
the
songs
don't
have
this
issue
for
me
i
feel
like
the
production
on
the
cd
is
kind
of
aloof
sounding
but
the
remixes
seem
richer
and
don't
have
this
issue
as
well
i
think
janet's
janet
has
aged
much
better
(i
know
i
know
they
are
different
cd's)

i
agree
with
you
both
not
everything
on
erotica
is
gold
but
the
album
holds
up
well
enough
because
it's
a
great
album

what
female
pop
artists
can
talk
about
sex
and
aids
and
where
life
begins
now?
and
what
artists
can
use
the
oldfashioned
latin
music
flamenco
and
speaking
words?
erotica
was
oldfashioned
even
at
its
time
of
release
not
many
people
like
it
then
but
it
grew
in
them
and
now
if
you
ask
a
lot
many
more
people
think
it's
better
as
it
ages
and
they
have
more
chance
to
actually
listen
to
65
minutes
of
it
when
it
comes
to
bjork
her
music
is
electronic
from
the
start
and
now
electronic
music
is
the
standard

you're
completely
spot
on
about
bjork's
debut
aging
wellit's
production
still
sounds
great
today
and
none
of
the
songs
sound
overlong
to
me
which
cannot
be
said
of
madonna's
erotica
from
the
same
time
period
