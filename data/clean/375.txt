rarely

formataudio
cd
a
good
collection
of
songs
from
the
beatle
period
and
early
solo
career
of
george
harrison
while
the
first
side
shows
some
of
the
peaks
of
george's
achievement
with
the
beatles
such
as
here
comes
the
sun
unquestionably
one
of
the
greatest
songs
ever
written
by
a
beatle
if
i
needed
someone
perhaps
george's
first
real
classic
track
and
while
my
guitar
gently
weeps
one
of
the
first
panoramic
rock
songs
there
could
have
been
more
imagination
in
the
selection
of
some
songs
(such
as
the
rejection
of
the
nice
but
insubstantial
for
you
blue
to
include
songs
like
old
brown
shoe
george's
last
bside
for
the
beatles
and
a
track
which
should
really
be
among
beatle
classics)
the
second
side
only
highlights
hit
singles
from
george's
solo
career
a
few
of
the
more
memorable
album
tracks
would
have
been
welcome
such
as
all
things
must
pass
living
in
the
material
world
etc
because
this
record
was
released
in
1976
it
obviously
does
not
have
any
later
releases
on
it
but
some
of
these
can
be
found
on
best
of
dark
horse
19761989
where
tracks
from
the
following
albums
can
be
heard
33
and
1/3
(1976)
the
excellent
george
harrison
album
of
1979
somewhere
in
england
('81)
gone
troppo
('82)
and
the
masterpiece
cloud
nine
('88)
both
of
these
albums
together
would
be
an
excellent
summary
of
george
harrison's
career

cd
george
harrison
was
a
couple
of
hits
shy
of
a
greatest
hits
package
when
(1976)
the
best
of
george
harrison
was
released
maybe
that's
why
his
greatest
beatles
hits
were
added
did
george
approve
that?
i
would
like
to
know
years
later
another
incomplete
harrison
collection
came
out
that
has
since
gone
out
of
print
that
one
covered
the
guitar
man's
career
from
the
mid70s
through
the
late
80s
my
dream
is

plus
two

from

album
something
and
while
my
guitar
gently
weeps
for
now
seek
out
these
george

which
i
consider
his

thirtythree

cd
this
collection
of
songs
features
the
musical
talents
of
l'angelo
mysterioso
as
a
beatle
and
doing
his
early
solo
years
(predark
horse)
george
was
active
in
the
early
70's
either
recording
his
own
material
or
producing
the
works
of
others
(most
notably
badfinger's
straight
up)
the
songs
on
this
cd
are
all
very
good
unfortunately
it
falls
short
of
the
mark
for
openers
half
the
cd
is
full
of
beatles
recorded
music
this
material
has
already
been
packaged
in
various
formats
the
songs
covering
george's
early
solo
years
are
terribly
incomplete
where
is
all
things
must
pass?
did
they
forget
about
the
bside
to
bangladesh
deep
blue?
why
didn't
beware
the
darkness
make
the
cut?
to
really
make
this
cd
more
competitive
capitol/emi
should
have
repackaged
it

you
know
add
some
bonus
tracks
like
the
one's
mentioned
above
if
capitol/emi
feels
that
they
should
mix
some
of
george's
beatle
contributions
into
this
cd
then
it
should
include
the
inner
light
however
i
believe
that
george
harrison
recorded
enough
good
material
as
a
solo
artist
to
full
any
cd
there
is
ample
material
available
from
his
apple
days
i
rated
this
cd
three
stars
because
(1)
the
beatle
material
has
been
offered
in
other
packages
thereby
making
half
this
cd
nothing
more
than
a
knockoff
of
previously
recorded
material
(2)
representatives
from
emi/capitol
could
have
selected
much
better
material
to
include
in
this
collection
of
greatest
hits
and
(3)
the
cd
should
have
been
repackaged
to
include
more
selections
thereby
making
it
more
complete
as
it
stands
right
now
this
cd
represents
nothing
more
than
a
record
company
holding
an
artist
to
the
terms
of
his
contract

by
way
of
cashing
in
on
a
name
(the
beatles)

cd
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
reviewers
who
believe
that
this
album
(here
on
cd
obviously)
is
simply
too
heavy
on
george's
work
as
a
member
of
the
beatles
where
is
more
of
his
solo
work?
where
is
some
great
b
side
tunes?
they're
simply
not
here
and
it
would
be
a
great
time
to
release
a
more
affordable
version
of
george's
best
since
dark
horse
is
wonderfully
extensive
but
too
expensive
for
many
people
this
1976
album
is
truly
overdue
for
an
update!
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
real
plusses
to
this
cd
first
it
is
a
great
introduction
to
george
harrison's
work
he
did
not
get
enough
attention
as
a
member
of
the
beatles
the
cd
starts
out
strong
with
a
perpetual
favorite
something
there
are
several
songs
which
demonstrate
his
work
with
the
beatles
taxman
and
the
hauntingly
beautiful
while
my
guitar
gently
weeps
are
included
there
is
the
beautiful
give
me
love
an
incredible
song
that
resonates
the
desire
for
love
and
total
harmonysomething
we
can
all
relate
to
the
album
then
ends
with
dark
horse
and
what
is
life
and
after
all
it
is
affordable
which
is
never
bad!
although
there
are
no
lyrics
provided
the
song
credits
are
there
along
with
some
nice
black
and
white
photos
of
harrison
the
cover
photo
of
george
with
the
yellow
car
is
great!
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
too
i
would
recommend
this
for
people
getting
to
know
george
it
also
has
bangla
desh
i
also
hope
that
there
can
be
an
affordable
and
complete
anthology
of
this
great
man's
work
in
the
very
near
future
