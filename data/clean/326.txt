singer
dobie
gray
here
performing
at
the
2004
ascap
pop
awards
died
tuesday
dobie
gray
who
recorded
one
of
the
most
excruciating
pop
hits
of
all
time
and
then
redeemed
himself
by
recording
one
of
the
best
died
tuesday
he
was
about
71
his
website
reported
his
death
without
providing
any
details
gray
was
born
in
texas
the
son
of
sharecroppers
and
details
of
his
early
life
including
his
precise
birthdate
are
vague
he
moved
to
los
angeles
in
the
early
1960s
and
after
several
years
on
the
fringe
of
the
music
business
he
scored
a
top20
hit
in
1965
with
“the
in
crowd”
while
it
had
a
catchy
beat
and
later
became
an
instrumental
hit
for
ramsey
lewis
its
lyrics
seemed
to
celebrate
the
kind
of
high
school
elitism
that
much
of
rock
’n’
roll
had
always
rebelled
against
“we
make
every
minute
count”
went
one
stanza
“our
share
is
always
the
biggest
amount”
ironically
gray
struggled
after
“the
in
crowd”
because
in
real
life
he
was
in
the
out
crowd
while
his
style
included
soul
pop
and
gospel
much
of
his
music
had
a
country
sound
and
country
music
had
few
black
performers
he
had
some
success
as
a
country
songwriter
having
his
songs
recorded
by
artists
like
charley
pride
and
tammy
wynette
he
also
acted
for
two
years
in
an
early
production
of
“hair”
then
in
1973
he
scored
his
biggest
hit
by
teaming
up
with
guitarist
reggie
young
for
“drift
away”
which
still
had
some
country
flavor
but
also
celebrated
rock
’n’
roll
and
eventually
rose
to
no
5
on
the
pop
charts
driven
by
an
irresistible
hook
in
its
chorus
“drift
away”
became
a
standard
around
multiple
radio
formats
and
reached
the
charts
again
30
years
later
when
uncle
kracker
recorded
a
version
with
a
very
similar
arrangement
and
sound
part
of
the
similarity
came
from
gray
singing
along
with
uncle
kracker
on
the
lead
vocals
the
song
reached
the
top
10
on
the
pop
charts
and
no
1
on
the
adult
contemporary
charts
gray’s
website
still
includes
his
final
message
which
declares
that
“better
days
are
ahead”
and
pays
tribute
to
dozens
of
artists
who
recently
died
