cd
this
is
a
best
of
compilation
which
is
quite
different
the
people
who
made
this
compilation
(for
better
or
worse)
decided
to
leave
out
many
of
the
singles
that
were
actually
released
by
modern
english
and
did
actually
get
some
decent
airplay
this
cd
is
not
about
playing
all
of
the
songs
everyone
knows

since
most
people
aren't
familiar
with
modern
english
anyway
this
cd
is
about
telling
the
story
about
one
of
the
most
underated
bands
of
all
time
yes
after
the
snow
is
definitely
a
better
album
and
i
really
do
wish
they
might
have
included
some
of
their
later
singles
and
not
just
included
album
cuts
from
the
later
albums
but
the
music
nonetheless
is
excellent
it
includes
some
of
their
earlier
dark
postpunk
experimental
rock
music
which
is
ultra
hard
to
find
it
has
the
most
popular
songs
from
mesh

lace
as
well
as
some
of
the
better
stuff
from
after
the
snow
including
the
classic
anthem
i
melt
with
you
it
also
features
many
excellent
songs
from
the
underrated
ricochet
days
album
the
cd
liner
notes
includes
a
history
of
the
band
as
well
as
an
intervue
with
two
of
the
band
members
if
you
love
postpunk
or
new
wave
music
you
will
love
this
album
the
bassist
is
as
good
as
peter
hook
the
synths
are
phenomenal
the
melodies
and
harmonies
and
lyrics
are
all
excellent
as
well
if
you
like
the
cure
new
order
joy
division
or
similar
music
definitely
check
this
album
out!

cd
modern
english
are
certainly
deserving
of
a
decent
best
of
but
this
one
featuring
songs
from
their
4ad
years
is
just
one
big
question
mark
the
darker
harsher
debut
mesh
and
lace
gets
far
too
much
coverage
here
and
their
best
two
albums

after
the
snow
and
ricochet
days

are
weakly
represented
for
starters
why
on
earth
someone
would
omit
someone's
calling
and
hands
across
the
sea
is
absolutely
beyond
me

two
of
their
quintessential
songs
i
almost
get
the
impression
that
this
one
was
compiled
by
a
fan
of
their
earlier
goth
sound
who
almost
begrudgingly
(and
smugly?)
includes
the
smash
i
melt
with
you
sandwiched
inappropriately
between
mesh
and
lace
material
it
would
be
nice
to
see
material
from
stop
start
(ink
and
paper
was
a
great
song)
and
possibly
even
pillow
lips
included
in
a
truly
comprehensive
compilation
because
this
one
widely
misses
the
mark
by
purporting
to
be
a
best

cd
modern
english
have
always
been
much
more
than
just
i
melt
with
you
in
fact
i
would
put
several
of
these
songs
on
this
disc
up
against
it
will
people
who
simply
know
them
through
valley
girl
be
put
off
by
the
darker
more
experimental
songs
like
gathering
dust
or
sixteen
days?
quite
possibly
but
then
they'd
really
be
missing
the
point
of
what
modern
english
were
trying
to
get
across
i
agree
songs
like
someone's
calling
or
hands
across
the
sea
should
have
been
included
but
overall
i
think
this
compilation
really
represents
what
modern
english
were
about
and
really
gets
at
the
sound
they
were
trying
to
convey
it's
also
a
bonus
that
they
didn't
include
material
from
any
of
the
albums
after
ricochet
days
the
lineup
had
changed
and
they
lost
their
direction
though
having
just
seen
them
live
they
seem
to
be
back
on
track
and
the
new
material
played
was
quite
good
albeit
