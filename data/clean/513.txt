biography
around
the
time
jack
ingram
started
writing
songs
and
performing
he
was
studying
psychology
at
southern
methodist
university
in
dallas
“music
and
psychology
come
from
the
same
place”
he
says
“it’s
about
studying
why
people
tick
i
write
songs
to
figure
out
my
world
why
people
act
the
way
they
do
why
they
make
the
decisions
they
do”
lucky
for
us
ingram
chose
a
career
in
musicand
discovered
an
altogether
different
kind
of
therapy
he
weaved
his
questions
about
life
into
songs
whose
depth
and
incisive
wit
were
matched
only
by
their
melodic
resonance
and
insistent
hooks
and
instead
of
charging
a
hundred
bucks
an
hour
to
listen
to
our
problems
ingram
took
to
the
stage
and
channeled
his
emotional
searching
his
quest
to
find
a
place
in
the
world
into
one
of
music’s
most
explosive
live
shows
you
can
hear
that
onstage
electricity
in
full
roar
on
live

wherever
you
are
ingram’s
first
release
on
nashville’s
new
big
machine
label
the
company
is
the
brainchild
of
industry
vet
scott
borchetta
and
country
superstar
toby
keith
in
whom
ingram
has
found
an
unlikely
kindred
spirit
“he
says
what
he
means
he
does
it
his
way
and
he
takes
a
stand”
says
ingram
“it’s
great
to
be
a
part
of
that
because
that’s
how
i’ve
always
been
as
well
i
know
exactly
who
i
am
and
what
i
want
to
sound
like”

prepackaged
and
forcefed
to
the
public
country
music

alive

love
you
come

a
close
second
and
third
not
a
big
fan
of
that
cover
of
lips
of
an
angel
though
nothing
against
jack
but
that
song
did
not
need
a
